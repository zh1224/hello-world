- **Abstrat**: Robot learning approaches such as behavior cloning and reinforcement learning have shown great promise in synthesizing robot skills from human demonstrations in specific environments. However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for unseen real-world settings. Recent advances in the use of foundation models for robotics (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) have shown great potential in enabling systems to understand the semantics in the world from large-scale internet data. However, it remains an open challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand the underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different tasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and self-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational agents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent, and a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy to relevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the action distribution of the policy to more desirable states, online, while remaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware platform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and in real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

## Augmenting the action space with conventions to improve multi-agent cooperation in Hanabi
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06333v2
- **Authors**: ['F. Bredell', 'H. A. Engelbrecht', 'J. C. Schoeman']
- **Abstrat**: The card game Hanabi is considered a strong medium for the testing and development of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, due to its cooperative nature, hidden information, limited communication and remarkable complexity. Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of ``rules''. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting the action space using conventions, which act as special cooperative actions that span over multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play across a various number of cooperators within Hanabi.

- **Abstrat**: Reward modeling has emerged as a promising approach for the scalable alignment of language models. However, contemporary reward models (RMs) often lack robustness, awarding high rewards to low-quality, out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This can lead to reward hacking, where policies exploit unintended shortcuts to maximize rewards, undermining alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce Adv-RM, a novel adversarial training framework that automatically identifies adversarial examples -- responses that receive high rewards from the target RM but are OOD and of low quality. By leveraging reinforcement learning, Adv-RM trains a policy to generate adversarial examples that reliably expose vulnerabilities in large state-of-the-art reward models such as Nemotron 340B RM. Incorporating these adversarial examples into the reward training process improves the robustness of RMs, mitigating reward hacking and enhancing downstream performance in RLHF. We demonstrate that Adv-RM significantly outperforms conventional RM training, increasing stability and enabling more effective RLHF training in both synthetic and real-data settings.





## A Multimedia Analytics Model for the Foundation Model Era
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06138v1
- **Authors**: ['Marcel Worring', 'Jan Zah√°lka', 'Stef van den Elzen', 'Maximilian Fischer', 'Daniel Keim']
- **Abstrat**: The rapid advances in Foundation Models and agentic Artificial Intelligence are transforming multimedia analytics by enabling richer, more sophisticated interactions between humans and analytical systems. Existing conceptual models for visual and multimedia analytics, however, do not adequately capture the complexity introduced by these powerful AI paradigms. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive multimedia analytics model specifically designed for the foundation model era. Building upon established frameworks from visual analytics, multimedia analytics, knowledge generation, analytic task definition, mixed-initiative guidance, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, our model emphasizes integrated human-AI teaming based on visual analytics agents from both technical and conceptual perspectives. Central to the model is a seamless, yet explicitly separable, interaction channel between expert users and semi-autonomous analytical processes, ensuring continuous alignment between user intent and AI behavior. The model addresses practical challenges in sensitive domains such as intelligence analysis, investigative journalism, and other fields handling complex, high-stakes data. We illustrate through detailed case studies how our model facilitates deeper understanding and targeted improvement of multimedia analytics solutions. By explicitly capturing how expert users can optimally interact with and guide AI-powered multimedia analytics systems, our conceptual framework sets a clear direction for system design, comparison, and future research.





## Accelerating Vehicle Routing via AI-Initialized Genetic Algorithms

- **Authors**: ['Ido Greenberg', 'Piotr Sielski', 'Hugo Linsenmaier', 'Rajesh Gandham', 'Shie Mannor', 'Alex Fender', 'Gal Chechik', 'Eli Meirom']
- **Abstrat**: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson Problem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization. Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging use-cases like interactive logistics planning. Such applications involve solving similar problem instances repeatedly, yet current state-of-the-art solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We introduce a novel optimization framework that uses a reinforcement learning agent - trained on prior instances - to quickly generate initial solutions, which are then further optimized by genetic algorithms. Our framework, Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI), consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time scales. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within 1s, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling applications like real-time and interactive routing. EARLI can generalize to new data, as demonstrated on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously unseen city. Our hybrid framework presents a new way to combine reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, paving the road for closer interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time optimization in diverse domains.





## Robo-taxi Fleet Coordination at Scale via Reinforcement Learning

- **Authors**: ['Luigi Tresca', 'Carolin Schmidt', 'James Harrison', 'Filipe Rodrigues', 'Gioele Zardini', 'Daniele Gammelli', 'Marco Pavone']
- **Abstrat**: Fleets of robo-taxis offering on-demand transportation services, commonly known as Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, hold significant promise for societal benefits, such as reducing pollution, energy consumption, and urban congestion. However, orchestrating these systems at scale remains a critical challenge, with existing coordination algorithms often failing to exploit the systems' full potential. This work introduces a novel decision-making framework that unites mathematical modeling with data-driven techniques. In particular, we present the AMoD coordination problem through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework that exploits the main strengths of graph representation learning, reinforcement learning, and classical operations research tools. Extensive evaluations across diverse simulation fidelities and scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, achieving superior system performance, computational efficiency, and generalizability compared to prior methods. Finally, motivated by the need to democratize research efforts in this area, we release publicly available benchmarks, datasets, and simulators for network-level coordination alongside an open-source codebase designed to provide accessible simulation platforms and establish a standardized validation process for comparing methodologies.

## Unraveling Arithmetic in Large Language Models: The Role of Algebraic Structures
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16260v2
- **Authors**: ['Fu-Chieh Chang', 'You-Chen Lin', 'Pei-Yuan Wu']
- **Abstrat**: The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, allowing models to solve complex tasks stepwise. However, training CoT capabilities requires detailed reasoning data, which is often scarce. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) framework addresses this by using reinforcement learning to automatically generate reasoning steps, reducing reliance on human-labeled data. Although STaR and its variants have demonstrated empirical success, a theoretical foundation explaining these improvements is lacking. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical capabilities, largely driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes complex reasoning into step-by-step solutions. However, the mechanisms underlying LLMs' ability to perform arithmetic in a single step of CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose that LLMs learn arithmetic by capturing algebraic structures, such as commutativity and identity properties. Since these structures are observable through input-output relationships, they can generalize to unseen data. We empirically demonstrate that LLMs can learn algebraic structures using a custom dataset of arithmetic problems, as well as providing theoretical evidence showing that, under specific configurations of weights and biases, the transformer-based LLMs can generate embeddings that remain invariant to both permutations of input tokens and the presence of identity elements. Our findings indicate that leveraging algebraic structures can enhance the LLMs' arithmetic capabilities, offering insights into improving their arithmetic performance.





## Leanabell-Prover: Posttraining Scaling in Formal Reasoning

- **Authors**: ['Jingyuan Zhang', 'Qi Wang', 'Xingguang Ji', 'Yahui Liu', 'Yang Yue', 'Fuzheng Zhang', 'Di Zhang', 'Guorui Zhou', 'Kun Gai']
- **Abstrat**: Recent advances in automated theorem proving (ATP) through LLMs have highlighted the potential of formal reasoning with Lean 4 codes. However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in natural languages.To begin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.





## Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09516v3
- **Authors**: ['Bowen Jin', 'Hansi Zeng', 'Zhenrui Yue', 'Jinsung Yoon', 'Sercan Arik', 'Dong Wang', 'Hamed Zamani', 'Jiawei Han']
- **Abstrat**: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

## Trust-Region Twisted Policy Improvement
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06048v1
- **Authors**: ['Joery A. de Vries', 'Jinke He', 'Yaniv Oren', 'Matthijs T. J. Spaan']
- **Abstrat**: Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has driven many recent breakthroughs in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet, persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC (TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.





## Information-Theoretic Reward Decomposition for Generalizable RLHF
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06020v1
- **Authors**: ['Liyuan Mao', 'Haoran Xu', 'Amy Zhang', 'Weinan Zhang', 'Chenjia Bai']
- **Abstrat**: A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.





## Improving Mixed-Criticality Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03994v2
- **Authors**: ['Muhammad El-Mahdy', 'Nourhan Sakr', 'Rodrigo Carrasco']
- **Abstrat**: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to scheduling mixed-criticality (MC) systems on processors with varying speeds. Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance.   Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.





## Smart Exploration in Reinforcement Learning using Bounded Uncertainty Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05978v1
- **Authors**: ['J. S. van Hulst', 'W. P. M. H. Heemels', 'D. J. Antunes']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for decision-making in uncertain environments, but it often requires large amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. We propose using prior model knowledge to guide the exploration process to speed up this learning process. This model knowledge comes in the form of a model set to which the true transition kernel and reward function belong. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also show that we obtain finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under additional assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly speed up the learning process in reinforcement learning.





## Toward Cost-efficient Adaptive Clinical Trials in Knee Osteoarthritis with Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02349v4
- **Authors**: ['Khanh Nguyen', 'Huy Hoang Nguyen', 'Egor Panfilov', 'Aleksei Tiulpin']
- **Abstrat**: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease, with knee OA (KOA) being one of the leading causes of disability and a significant economic burden. Predicting KOA progression is crucial for improving patient outcomes, optimizing healthcare resources, studying the disease, and developing new treatments. The latter application particularly requires one to understand the disease progression in order to collect the most informative data at the right time. Existing methods, however, are limited by their static nature and their focus on individual joints, leading to suboptimal predictive performance and downstream utility. Our study proposes a new method that allows to dynamically monitor patients rather than individual joints with KOA using a novel Active Sensing (AS) approach powered by Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our key idea is to directly optimize for the downstream task by training an agent that maximizes informative data collection while minimizing overall costs. Our RL-based method leverages a specially designed reward function to monitor disease progression across multiple body parts, employs multimodal deep learning, and requires no human input during testing. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art models, paving the way for the next generation of KOA trials.





## AEGIS: Human Attention-based Explainable Guidance for Intelligent Vehicle Systems
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05950v1
- **Authors**: ['Zhuoli Zhuang', 'Cheng-You Lu', 'Yu-Cheng Fred Chang', 'Yu-Kai Wang', 'Thomas Do', 'Chin-Teng Lin']
- **Abstrat**: Improving decision-making capabilities in Autonomous Intelligent Vehicles (AIVs) has been a heated topic in recent years. Despite advancements, training machines to capture regions of interest for comprehensive scene understanding, like human perception and reasoning, remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel framework, Human Attention-based Explainable Guidance for Intelligent Vehicle Systems (AEGIS). AEGIS utilizes human attention, converted from eye-tracking, to guide reinforcement learning (RL) models to identify critical regions of interest for decision-making. AEGIS uses a pre-trained human attention model to guide RL models to identify critical regions of interest for decision-making. By collecting 1.2 million frames from 20 participants across six scenarios, AEGIS pre-trains a model to predict human attention patterns.





## Deep RL-based Autonomous Navigation of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in a complex GPS-denied Indoor Environment
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05918v1
- **Authors**: ['Amit Kumar Singh', 'Prasanth Kumar Duba', 'P. Rajalakshmi']
- **Abstrat**: The Autonomy of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in indoor environments poses significant challenges due to the lack of reliable GPS signals in enclosed spaces such as warehouses, factories, and indoor facilities. Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are preferred for navigating in these complex, GPS-denied scenarios because of their agility, low power consumption, and limited computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning based Deep-Proximal Policy Optimization (D-PPO) algorithm to enhance realtime navigation through improving the computation efficiency. The end-to-end network is trained in 3D realistic meta-environments created using the Unreal Engine. With these trained meta-weights, the MAV system underwent extensive experimental trials in real-world indoor environments. The results indicate that the proposed method reduces computational latency by 91\% during training period without significant degradation in performance. The algorithm was tested on a DJI Tello drone, yielding similar results.





## Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization: Balancing Safety-Helpfulness in Language Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15313v2
- **Authors**: ['Wenxuan Zhang', 'Philip H. S. Torr', 'Mohamed Elhoseiny', 'Adel Bibi']
- **Abstrat**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on human preferences, typically through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has proven successful in enhancing their capabilities. However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture the global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark that includes comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO achieves the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor with less than 10\% of the computational resources and human prompting and annotation process. The training recipes can be found here: https://github.com/wx-zhang/bfpo.





## Learning strategies for optimised fitness in a model of cyclic dominance
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05886v1
- **Authors**: ['Honghao Yu', 'Robert L. Jack']
- **Abstrat**: A major problem in evolutionary biology is how species learn and adapt under the constraint of environmental conditions and competition of other species. Models of cyclic dominance provide simplified settings in which such questions can be addressed using methods from theoretical physics. We investigate how a privileged ("smart") species optimises its population by adopting advantageous strategies in one such model. We use a reinforcement learning algorithm, which successfully identifies optimal strategies based on a survival-of-the-weakest effect, including directional incentives to avoid predators. We also characterise the steady-state behaviour of the system in the presence of the smart species and compare with the symmetric case where all species are equivalent.





## Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model: A Natural Generalization of Bradley-Terry Reward Model
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22480v3
- **Authors**: ['Wangtao Sun', 'Xiang Cheng', 'Xing Yu', 'Haotian Xu', 'Zhao Yang', 'Shizhu He', 'Jun Zhao', 'Kang Liu']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical technique for training large language models. However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed uncertain reward model to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that directly model the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the reward distribution uncertainty calculation based on Bhattacharyya Coefficient. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. We propose a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of PURM. Experiments demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final reward performance, outperforming baseline methods in both stability and effectiveness.





## Momentum Boosted Episodic Memory for Improving Learning in Long-Tailed RL Environments
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05840v1
- **Authors**: ['Dolton Fernandes', 'Pramod Kaushik', 'Harsh Shukla', 'Bapi Raju Surampudi']
- **Abstrat**: Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms assume the distribution of the data to be uniform or mostly uniform. However, this is not the case with most real-world applications like autonomous driving or in nature where animals roam. Some experiences are encountered frequently, and most of the remaining experiences occur rarely; the resulting distribution is called Zipfian. Taking inspiration from the theory of complementary learning systems, an architecture for learning from Zipfian distributions is proposed where important long tail trajectories are discovered in an unsupervised manner. The proposal comprises an episodic memory buffer containing a prioritised memory module to ensure important rare trajectories are kept longer to address the Zipfian problem, which needs credit assignment to happen in a sample efficient manner. The experiences are then reinstated from episodic memory and given weighted importance forming the trajectory to be executed. Notably, the proposed architecture is modular, can be incorporated in any RL architecture and yields improved performance in multiple Zipfian tasks over traditional architectures. Our method outperforms IMPALA by a significant margin on all three tasks and all three evaluation metrics (Zipfian, Uniform, and Rare Accuracy) and also gives improvements on most Atari environments that are considered challenging

## ActiveGS: Active Scene Reconstruction Using Gaussian Splatting
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17769v2
- **Authors**: ['Liren Jin', 'Xingguang Zhong', 'Yue Pan', 'Jens Behley', 'Cyrill Stachniss', 'Marija Popoviƒá']
- **Abstrat**: Robotics applications often rely on scene reconstructions to enable downstream tasks. In this work, we tackle the challenge of actively building an accurate map of an unknown scene using an RGB-D camera on a mobile platform. We propose a hybrid map representation that combines a Gaussian splatting map with a coarse voxel map, leveraging the strengths of both representations: the high-fidelity scene reconstruction capabilities of Gaussian splatting and the spatial modelling strengths of the voxel map. At the core of our framework is an effective confidence modelling technique for the Gaussian splatting map to identify under-reconstructed areas, while utilising spatial information from the voxel map to target unexplored areas and assist in collision-free path planning. By actively collecting scene information in under-reconstructed and unexplored areas for map updates, our approach achieves superior Gaussian splatting reconstruction results compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate the real-world applicability of our framework using an unmanned aerial vehicle.





## Exploring Adversarial Obstacle Attacks in Search-based Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06154v1
- **Authors**: ['Adrian Szvoren', 'Jianwei Liu', 'Dimitrios Kanoulas', 'Nilufer Tuptuk']
- **Abstrat**: Path planning algorithms, such as the search-based A*, are a critical component of autonomous mobile robotics, enabling robots to navigate from a starting point to a destination efficiently and safely. We investigated the resilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial interventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversary's goal is to delay the robot's timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its original path.   We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation, the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36\%, with the most significant delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially longer alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing measurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithm's robustness is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the operational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels, the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative routes.





## Real-Time LaCAM
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06091v1
- **Authors**: ['Runzhe Liang', 'Rishi Veerapaneni', 'Daniel Harabor', 'Jiaoyang Li', 'Maxim Likhachev']
- **Abstrat**: The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with completeness guarantees require planning full horizon paths. However, planning full horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world applications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the planner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more practical for real world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time planning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or deadlock. Our main contribution is to show the first Real-Time MAPF method with provable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM (Okumura 2023) in an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for congested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still maintaining the same success rate as full horizon LaCAM. We also show how it can be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy. The proposed Real-Time LaCAM also provides us with a general mechanism for using iterative constraints for completeness in future real-time MAPF algorithms.





## Accelerated Reeds-Shepp and Under-Specified Reeds-Shepp Algorithms for Mobile Robot Path Planning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05921v1
- **Authors**: ['Ibrahim Ibrahim', 'Wilm Decr√©', 'Jan Swevers']
- **Abstrat**: In this study, we present a simple and intuitive method for accelerating optimal Reeds-Shepp path computation. Our approach uses geometrical reasoning to analyze the behavior of optimal paths, resulting in a new partitioning of the state space and a further reduction in the minimal set of viable paths. We revisit and reimplement classic methodologies from the literature, which lack contemporary open-source implementations, to serve as benchmarks for evaluating our method. Additionally, we address the under-specified Reeds-Shepp planning problem where the final orientation is unspecified. We perform exhaustive experiments to validate our solutions. Compared to the modern C++ implementation of the original Reeds-Shepp solution in the Open Motion Planning Library, our method demonstrates a 15x speedup, while classic methods achieve a 5.79x speedup. Both approaches exhibit machine-precision differences in path lengths compared to the original solution. We release our proposed C++ implementations for both the accelerated and under-specified Reeds-Shepp problems as open-source code.





## MAPF-GPT: Imitation Learning for Multi-Agent Pathfinding at Scale
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00134v5
- **Authors**: ['Anton Andreychuk', 'Konstantin Yakovlev', 'Aleksandr Panov', 'Alexey Skrynnik']
- **Abstrat**: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a problem that generally requires finding collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment. Solving MAPF optimally, even under restrictive assumptions, is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions for this problem are critical for numerous applications, such as automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Typically, such learning-based MAPF solvers are augmented with additional components like single-agent planning or communication. Orthogonally, in this work we rely solely on imitation learning that leverages a large dataset of expert MAPF solutions and transformer-based neural network to create a foundation model for MAPF called MAPF-GPT. The latter is capable of generating actions without additional heuristics or communication. MAPF-GPT demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problems that are not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is computationally efficient during inference.
