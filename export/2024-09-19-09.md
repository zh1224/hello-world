- **Abstrat**: Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect the mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.

- **Abstrat**: Robots can influence people to accomplish their tasks more efficiently: autonomous cars can inch forward at an intersection to pass through, and tabletop manipulators can go for an object on the table first. However, a robot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE (Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional (39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate during task execution.





## Almost Sure Convergence of Linear Temporal Difference Learning with Arbitrary Features
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12135v1
- **Authors**: ['Jiuqi Wang', 'Shangtong Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: Temporal difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, abbreviated as linear TD, is a classic and powerful prediction algorithm in reinforcement learning. While it is well understood that linear TD converges almost surely to a unique point, this convergence traditionally requires the assumption that the features used by the approximator are linearly independent. However, this linear independence assumption does not hold in many practical scenarios. This work is the first to establish the almost sure convergence of linear TD without requiring linearly independent features. In fact, we do not make any assumptions on the features. We prove that the approximated value function converges to a unique point and the weight iterates converge to a set. We also establish a notion of local stability of the weight iterates. Importantly, we do not need to introduce any other additional assumptions and do not need to make any modification to the linear TD algorithm. Key to our analysis is a novel characterization of bounded invariant sets of the mean ODE of linear TD.

- **Abstrat**: In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models: Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model, it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct. (3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling, optimizing the model's performance.   Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math competition problems.





## IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12092v1
- **Authors**: ['Rui Liu', 'Zahiruddin Mahammad', 'Amisha Bhaskar', 'Pratap Tokekar']
- **Abstrat**: Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance. We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition. Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline.





## Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045v1
- **Authors**: ['Jonas GÃ¼nster', 'Puze Liu', 'Jan Peters', 'Davide Tateo']
- **Abstrat**: Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them in complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while maintaining safer behavior during training.





## Putting Data at the Centre of Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12001v1
- **Authors**: ['Claude Formanek', 'Louise Beyers', 'Callum Rhys Tilbury', 'Jonathan P. Shock', 'Arnu Pretorius']
- **Abstrat**: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an exciting direction of research that uses static datasets to find optimal control policies for multi-agent systems. Though the field is by definition data-driven, efforts have thus far neglected data in their drive to achieve state-of-the-art results. We first substantiate this claim by surveying the literature, showing how the majority of works generate their own datasets without consistent methodology and provide sparse information about the characteristics of these datasets. We then show why neglecting the nature of the data is problematic, through salient examples of how tightly algorithmic performance is coupled to the dataset used, necessitating a common foundation for experiments in the field. In response, we take a big step towards improving data usage and data awareness in offline MARL, with three key contributions: (1) a clear guideline for generating novel datasets; (2) a standardisation of over 80 existing datasets, hosted in a publicly available repository, using a consistent storage format and easy-to-use API; and (3) a suite of analysis tools that allow us to understand these datasets better, aiding further development.





## Data-Efficient Quadratic Q-Learning Using LMIs
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11986v1
- **Authors**: ['J. S. van Hulst', 'W. P. M. H. Heemels', 'D. J. Antunes']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant research and application results but often requires large amounts of training data. This paper proposes two data-efficient off-policy RL methods that use parametrized Q-learning. In these methods, the Q-function is chosen to be linear in the parameters and quadratic in selected basis functions in the state and control deviations from a base policy. A cost penalizing the $\ell_1$-norm of Bellman errors is minimized. We propose two methods: Linear Matrix Inequality Q-Learning (LMI-QL) and its iterative variant (LMI-QLi), which solve the resulting episodic optimization problem through convex optimization. LMI-QL relies on a convex relaxation that yields a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). LMI-QLi entails solving sequential iterations of an SDP problem. Both methods combine convex optimization with direct Q-function learning, significantly improving learning speed. A numerical case study demonstrates their advantages over existing parametrized Q-learning methods.





## A Single-Loop Deep Actor-Critic Algorithm for Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Provable Convergence
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06402v2
- **Authors**: ['Kexuan Wang', 'An Liu', 'Baishuo Lin']
- **Abstrat**: Deep Actor-Critic algorithms, which combine Actor-Critic with deep neural network (DNN), have been among the most prevalent reinforcement learning algorithms for decision-making problems in simulated environments. However, the existing deep Actor-Critic algorithms are still not mature to solve realistic problems with non-convex stochastic constraints and high cost to interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a single-loop deep Actor-Critic (SLDAC) algorithmic framework for general constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) problems. In the actor step, the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method is applied to handle the non-convex stochastic objective and constraints. In the critic step, the critic DNNs are only updated once or a few finite times for each iteration, which simplifies the algorithm to a single-loop framework (the existing works require a sufficient number of updates for the critic step to ensure a good enough convergence of the inner loop for each iteration). Moreover, the variance of the policy gradient estimation is reduced by reusing observations from the old policy. The single-loop design and the observation reuse effectively reduce the agent-environment interaction cost and computational complexity. In spite of the biased policy gradient estimation incurred by the single-loop design and observation reuse, we prove that the SLDAC with a feasible initial point can converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tuker (KKT) point of the original problem almost surely. Simulations show that the SLDAC algorithm can achieve superior performance with much lower interaction cost.





## Reinforcement Learning with Lie Group Orientations for Robotics
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11935v1
- **Authors**: ['Martin Schuck', 'Jan BrÃ¼digam', 'Sandra Hirche', 'Angela Schoellig']
- **Abstrat**: Handling orientations of robots and objects is a crucial aspect of many applications. Yet, ever so often, there is a lack of mathematical correctness when dealing with orientations, especially in learning pipelines involving, for example, artificial neural networks. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning with orientations and propose a simple modification of the network's input and output that adheres to the Lie group structure of orientations. As a result, we obtain an easy and efficient implementation that is directly usable with existing learning libraries and achieves significantly better performance than other common orientation representations. We briefly introduce Lie theory specifically for orientations in robotics to motivate and outline our approach. Subsequently, a thorough empirical evaluation of different combinations of orientation representations for states and actions demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach in different scenarios, including: direct orientation control, end effector orientation control, and pick-and-place tasks.





## Reinforcement Learning as an Improvement Heuristic for Real-World Production Scheduling
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11933v1
- **Authors**: ['Arthur MÃ¼ller', 'Lukas Vollenkemper']
- **Abstrat**: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with heuristic methods is an emerging trend for solving optimization problems, which leverages RL's ability to learn from the data generated during the search process. One promising approach is to train an RL agent as an improvement heuristic, starting with a suboptimal solution that is iteratively improved by applying small changes. We apply this approach to a real-world multiobjective production scheduling problem. Our approach utilizes a network architecture that includes Transformer encoding to learn the relationships between jobs. Afterwards, a probability matrix is generated from which pairs of jobs are sampled and then swapped to improve the solution. We benchmarked our approach against other heuristics using real data from our industry partner, demonstrating its superior performance.





## Secure Control Systems for Autonomous Quadrotors against Cyber-Attacks
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11897v1
- **Authors**: ['Samuel Belkadi']
- **Abstrat**: The problem of safety for robotic systems has been extensively studied. However, little attention has been given to security issues for three-dimensional systems, such as quadrotors. Malicious adversaries can compromise robot sensors and communication networks, causing incidents, achieving illegal objectives, or even injuring people. This study first designs an intelligent control system for autonomous quadrotors. Then, it investigates the problems of optimal false data injection attack scheduling and countermeasure design for unmanned aerial vehicles. Using a state-of-the-art deep learning-based approach, an optimal false data injection attack scheme is proposed to deteriorate a quadrotor's tracking performance with limited attack energy. Subsequently, an optimal tracking control strategy is learned to mitigate attacks and recover the quadrotor's tracking performance. We base our work on Agilicious, a state-of-the-art quadrotor recently deployed for autonomous settings. This paper is the first in the United Kingdom to deploy this quadrotor and implement reinforcement learning on its platform. Therefore, to promote easy reproducibility with minimal engineering overhead, we further provide (1) a comprehensive breakdown of this quadrotor, including software stacks and hardware alternatives; (2) a detailed reinforcement-learning framework to train autonomous controllers on Agilicious agents; and (3) a new open-source environment that builds upon PyFlyt for future reinforcement learning research on Agilicious platforms. Both simulated and real-world experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks in section 5.2.





## XP-MARL: Auxiliary Prioritization in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to Address Non-Stationarity
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11852v1
- **Authors**: ['Jianye Xu', 'Omar Sobhy', 'Bassam Alrifaee']
- **Abstrat**: Non-stationarity poses a fundamental challenge in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), arising from agents simultaneously learning and altering their policies. This creates a non-stationary environment from the perspective of each individual agent, often leading to suboptimal or even unconverged learning outcomes. We propose an open-source framework named XP-MARL, which augments MARL with auxiliary prioritization to address this challenge in cooperative settings. XP-MARL is 1) founded upon our hypothesis that prioritizing agents and letting higher-priority agents establish their actions first would stabilize the learning process and thus mitigate non-stationarity and 2) enabled by our proposed mechanism called action propagation, where higher-priority agents act first and communicate their actions, providing a more stationary environment for others. Moreover, instead of using a predefined or heuristic priority assignment, XP-MARL learns priority-assignment policies with an auxiliary MARL problem, leading to a joint learning scheme. Experiments in a motion-planning scenario involving Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) demonstrate that XP-MARL improves the safety of a baseline model by 84.4% and outperforms a state-of-the-art approach, which improves the baseline by only 12.8%.

## Explore-Go: Leveraging Exploration for Generalisation in Deep Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08069v3
- **Authors**: ['Max Weltevrede', 'Felix Kaubek', 'Matthijs T. J. Spaan', 'Wendelin BÃ¶hmer']
- **Abstrat**: One of the remaining challenges in reinforcement learning is to develop agents that can generalise to novel scenarios they might encounter once deployed. This challenge is often framed in a multi-task setting where agents train on a fixed set of tasks and have to generalise to new tasks. Recent work has shown that in this setting increased exploration during training can be leveraged to increase the generalisation performance of the agent. This makes sense when the states encountered during testing can actually be explored during training. In this paper, we provide intuition why exploration can also benefit generalisation to states that cannot be explicitly encountered during training. Additionally, we propose a novel method Explore-Go that exploits this intuition by increasing the number of states on which the agent trains. Explore-Go effectively increases the starting state distribution of the agent and as a result can be used in conjunction with most existing on-policy or off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. We show empirically that our method can increase generalisation performance in an illustrative environment and on the Procgen benchmark.





## Optimizing Job Shop Scheduling in the Furniture Industry: A Reinforcement Learning Approach Considering Machine Setup, Batch Variability, and Intralogistics
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11820v1
- **Authors**: ['Malte Schneevogt', 'Karsten Binninger', 'Noah Klarmann']
- **Abstrat**: This paper explores the potential application of Deep Reinforcement Learning in the furniture industry. To offer a broad product portfolio, most furniture manufacturers are organized as a job shop, which ultimately results in the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). The JSSP is addressed with a focus on extending traditional models to better represent the complexities of real-world production environments. Existing approaches frequently fail to consider critical factors such as machine setup times or varying batch sizes. A concept for a model is proposed that provides a higher level of information detail to enhance scheduling accuracy and efficiency. The concept introduces the integration of DRL for production planning, particularly suited to batch production industries such as the furniture industry. The model extends traditional approaches to JSSPs by including job volumes, buffer management, transportation times, and machine setup times. This enables more precise forecasting and analysis of production flows and processes, accommodating the variability and complexity inherent in real-world manufacturing processes. The RL agent learns to optimize scheduling decisions. It operates within a discrete action space, making decisions based on detailed observations. A reward function guides the agent's decision-making process, thereby promoting efficient scheduling and meeting production deadlines. Two integration strategies for implementing the RL agent are discussed: episodic planning, which is suitable for low-automation environments, and continuous planning, which is ideal for highly automated plants. While episodic planning can be employed as a standalone solution, the continuous planning approach necessitates the integration of the agent with ERP and Manufacturing Execution Systems. This integration enables real-time adjustments to production schedules based on dynamic changes.

## Autonomous Navigation in Ice-Covered Waters with Learned Predictions on Ship-Ice Interactions
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11326v2
- **Authors**: ['Ninghan Zhong', 'Alessandro Potenza', 'Stephen L. Smith']
- **Abstrat**: Autonomous navigation in ice-covered waters poses significant challenges due to the frequent lack of viable collision-free trajectories. When complete obstacle avoidance is infeasible, it becomes imperative for the navigation strategy to minimize collisions. Additionally, the dynamic nature of ice, which moves in response to ship maneuvers, complicates the path planning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model to estimate the coarse dynamics of ice movements triggered by ship actions through occupancy estimation. To ensure real-time applicability, we propose a novel approach that caches intermediate prediction results and seamlessly integrates the predictive model into a graph search planner. We evaluate the proposed planner both in simulation and in a physical testbed against existing approaches and show that our planner significantly reduces collisions with ice when compared to the state-of-the-art. Codes and demos of this work are available at https://github.com/IvanIZ/predictive-asv-planner.
