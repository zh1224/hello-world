- **Abstrat**: Humanoid robots, with their human-like skeletal structure, are especially suited for tasks in human-centric environments. However, this structure is accompanied by additional challenges in locomotion controller design, especially in complex real-world environments. As a result, existing humanoid robots are limited to relatively simple terrains, either with model-based control or model-free reinforcement learning. In this work, we introduce Denoising World Model Learning (DWL), an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework for humanoid locomotion control, which demonstrates the world's first humanoid robot to master real-world challenging terrains such as snowy and inclined land in the wild, up and down stairs, and extremely uneven terrains. All scenarios run the same learned neural network with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, indicating the superior robustness and generalization capability of the proposed method.

- **Abstrat**: The rise of renewable energy and distributed generation requires new approaches to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. In this context, Graph Neural Networks are promising due to their ability to learn from graph-structured data. Combined with Reinforcement Learning, they can serve as control approaches to determine remedial network actions. This review analyses how Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL) can improve representation learning and decision making in power grid use cases. Although GRL has demonstrated adaptability to unpredictable events and noisy data, it is primarily at a proof-of-concept stage. We highlight open challenges and limitations with respect to real-world applications.

- **Abstrat**: Incorporating inductive biases is a promising approach for tackling challenging robot learning domains with sample-efficient solutions. This paper identifies partially observable domains where symmetries can be a useful inductive bias for efficient learning. Specifically, by encoding the equivariance regarding specific group symmetries into the neural networks, our actor-critic reinforcement learning agents can reuse solutions in the past for related scenarios. Consequently, our equivariant agents outperform non-equivariant approaches significantly in terms of sample efficiency and final performance, demonstrated through experiments on a range of robotic tasks in simulation and real hardware.





## Advantageous and disadvantageous inequality aversion can be taught through vicarious learning of others' preferences

- **Authors**: ['Shen Zhang', 'Oriel FeldmanHall', 'Sébastien Hétu', 'A. Ross Otto']
- **Abstrat**: While enforcing egalitarian social norms is critical for human society, punishing social norm violators often incurs a cost to the self. This cost looms even larger when one can benefit from an unequal distribution of resources (i.e. advantageous inequity), as in receiving a higher salary than a colleague with the identical role. In the Ultimatum Game, a classic test bed for fairness norm enforcement, individuals rarely reject (punish) such unequal proposed divisions of resources because doing so entails a sacrifice of one's own benefit. Recent work has demonstrated that observing another's punitive responses to unfairness can efficiently alter the punitive preferences of an observer. It remains an open question, however, whether such contagion is powerful enough to impart advantageous inequity aversion to individuals. Using a variant of the Ultimatum Game in which participants are tasked with responding to fairness violations on behalf of another 'Teacher' - whose aversion to advantageous (versus disadvantageous) inequity was systematically manipulated-we probe whether individuals subsequently increase their punishment unfair after experiencing fairness violations on their own behalf. In two experiments, we found individuals can acquire aversion to advantageous inequity 'vicariously' through observing (and implementing) the Teacher's preferences. Computationally, these learning effects were best characterized by a model which learns the latent structure of the Teacher's preferences, rather than a simple Reinforcement Learning account. In summary, our study is the first to demonstrate that people can swiftly and readily acquire another's preferences for advantageous inequity, suggesting in turn that behavioral contagion may be one promising mechanism through which social norm enforcement - which people rarely implement in the case of advantageous inequality - can be enhanced.

- **Abstrat**: Recently, humanoid robots have made significant advances in their ability to perform challenging tasks due to the deployment of Reinforcement Learning (RL), however, the inherent complexity of humanoid robots, including the difficulty of designing complicated reward functions and training entire sophisticated systems, still poses a notable challenge. To conquer these challenges, after many iterations and in-depth investigations, we have meticulously developed a full-size humanoid robot, "Adam", whose innovative structural design greatly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the imitation learning process. In addition, we have developed a novel imitation learning framework based on an adversarial motion prior, which applies not only to Adam but also to humanoid robots in general. Using the framework, Adam can exhibit unprecedented human-like characteristics in locomotion tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables Adam to achieve human-comparable performance in complex locomotion tasks, marking the first time that human locomotion data has been used for imitation learning in a full-size humanoid robot.





## Efficient Active Flow Control Strategy for Confined Square Cylinder Wake Using Deep Learning-Based Surrogate Model and Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14232v1
- **Authors**: ['Meng Zhang', 'Mustafa Z. Yousif', 'Minze Xu', 'Haifeng Zhou', 'Linqi Yu', 'HeeChang Lim']
- **Abstrat**: This study presents a deep learning model-based reinforcement learning (DL-MBRL) approach for active control of two-dimensional (2D) wake flow past a square cylinder using antiphase jets. The DL-MBRL framework alternates between interacting with a deep learning surrogate model (DL-SM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to suppress wake vortex shedding, significantly reducing computational costs. The DL-SM, which combines a Transformer and a multiscale enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (MS-ESRGAN), effectively models complex flow dynamics, efficiently emulating the CFD environment. Trained on 2D direct numerical simulation (DNS) data, the Transformer and MS-ESRGAN demonstrated excellent agreement with DNS results, validating the DL-SM's accuracy. Error analysis suggests replacing the DL-SM with CFD every five interactions to maintain reliability. While DL-MBRL showed less robust convergence than model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) during training, it reduced training time by 49.2%, from 41.87 hours to 20.62 hours. Both MFRL and DL-MBRL achieved a 98% reduction in shedding energy and a 95% reduction in the standard deviation of the lift coefficient (C_L). However, MFRL exhibited a nonzero mean lift coefficient due to insufficient exploration, whereas DL-MBRL improved exploration by leveraging the randomness of the DL-SM, resolving the nonzero mean C_L issue. This study demonstrates that DL-MBRL is not only comparably effective but also superior to MFRL in flow stabilization, with significantly reduced training time, highlighting the potential of combining deep reinforcement learning with DL-SM for enhanced active flow control.





## Demystifying the Recency Heuristic in Temporal-Difference Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12284v2
- **Authors**: ['Brett Daley', 'Marlos C. Machado', 'Martha White']
- **Abstrat**: The recency heuristic in reinforcement learning is the assumption that stimuli that occurred closer in time to an acquired reward should be more heavily reinforced. The recency heuristic is one of the key assumptions made by TD($\lambda$), which reinforces recent experiences according to an exponentially decaying weighting. In fact, all other widely used return estimators for TD learning, such as $n$-step returns, satisfy a weaker (i.e., non-monotonic) recency heuristic. Why is the recency heuristic effective for temporal credit assignment? What happens when credit is assigned in a way that violates this heuristic? In this paper, we analyze the specific mathematical implications of adopting the recency heuristic in TD learning. We prove that any return estimator satisfying this heuristic: 1) is guaranteed to converge to the correct value function, 2) has a relatively fast contraction rate, and 3) has a long window of effective credit assignment, yet bounded worst-case variance. We also give a counterexample where on-policy, tabular TD methods violating the recency heuristic diverge. Our results offer some of the first theoretical evidence that credit assignment based on the recency heuristic facilitates learning.





## DynamicRouteGPT: A Real-Time Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Navigation Framework Based on Large Language Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14185v1
- **Authors**: ['Ziai Zhou', 'Bin Zhou', 'Hao Liu']
- **Abstrat**: Real-time dynamic path planning in complex traffic environments presents challenges, such as varying traffic volumes and signal wait times. Traditional static routing algorithms like Dijkstra and A* compute shortest paths but often fail under dynamic conditions. Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches offer improvements but tend to focus on local optima, risking dead-ends or boundary issues. This paper proposes a novel approach based on causal inference for real-time dynamic path planning, balancing global and local optimality. We first use the static Dijkstra algorithm to compute a globally optimal baseline path. A distributed control strategy then guides vehicles along this path. At intersections, DynamicRouteGPT performs real-time decision-making for local path selection, considering real-time traffic, driving preferences, and unexpected events. DynamicRouteGPT integrates Markov chains, Bayesian inference, and large-scale pretrained language models like Llama3 8B to provide an efficient path planning solution. It dynamically adjusts to traffic scenarios and driver preferences and requires no pre-training, offering broad applicability across road networks. A key innovation is the construction of causal graphs for counterfactual reasoning, optimizing path decisions. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time dynamic path planning for multiple vehicles while providing explainable path selections, offering a novel and efficient solution for complex traffic environments.

- **Abstrat**: The advent of large language models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and others has underscored the importance of evaluating their diverse capabilities, ranging from natural language understanding to code generation. However, their performance on spatial tasks has not been comprehensively assessed. This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel multi-task spatial evaluation dataset, designed to systematically explore and compare the performance of several advanced models on spatial tasks. The dataset encompasses twelve distinct task types, including spatial understanding and path planning, each with verified, accurate answers. We evaluated multiple models, including OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4o, and ZhipuAI's glm-4, through a two-phase testing approach. Initially, we conducted zero-shot testing, followed by categorizing the dataset by difficulty and performing prompt tuning tests. Results indicate that gpt-4o achieved the highest overall accuracy in the first phase, with an average of 71.3%. Although moonshot-v1-8k slightly underperformed overall, it surpassed gpt-4o in place name recognition tasks. The study also highlights the impact of prompt strategies on model performance in specific tasks. For example, the Chain-of-Thought (COT) strategy increased gpt-4o's accuracy in path planning from 12.4% to 87.5%, while a one-shot strategy enhanced moonshot-v1-8k's accuracy in mapping tasks from 10.1% to 76.3%.





## Model Predictive Parkour Control of a Monoped Hopper in Dynamically Changing Environments

- **Abstrat**: A great advantage of legged robots is their ability to operate on particularly difficult and obstructed terrain, which demands dynamic, robust, and precise movements. The study of obstacle courses provides invaluable insights into the challenges legged robots face, offering a controlled environment to assess and enhance their capabilities. Traversing it with a one-legged hopper introduces intricate challenges, such as planning over contacts and dealing with flight phases, which necessitates a sophisticated controller. A novel model predictive parkour controller is introduced, that finds an optimal path through a real-time changing obstacle course with mixed integer motion planning. The execution of this optimized path is then achieved through a state machine employing a PD control scheme with feedforward torques, ensuring robust and accurate performance.
