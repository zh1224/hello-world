- **Abstrat**: The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2) limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions, and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents (UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ZeroGUI.

- **Abstrat**: Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical exploration.





## PixelThink: Towards Efficient Chain-of-Pixel Reasoning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23727v1
- **Authors**: ['Song Wang', 'Gongfan Fang', 'Lingdong Kong', 'Xiangtai Li', 'Jianyun Xu', 'Sheng Yang', 'Qiang Li', 'Jianke Zhu', 'Xinchao Wang']
- **Abstrat**: Existing reasoning segmentation approaches typically fine-tune multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using image-text pairs and corresponding mask labels. However, they exhibit limited generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios without an explicit reasoning process. Although recent efforts leverage reinforcement learning through group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) to enhance reasoning ability, they often suffer from overthinking -producing uniformly verbose reasoning chains irrespective of task complexity. This results in elevated computational costs and limited control over reasoning quality. To address this problem, we propose PixelThink, a simple yet effective scheme that integrates externally estimated task difficulty and internally measured model uncertainty to regulate reasoning generation within a reinforcement learning paradigm. The model learns to compress reasoning length in accordance with scene complexity and predictive confidence. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ReasonSeg-Diff, an extended benchmark with annotated reasoning references and difficulty scores, along with a suite of metrics designed to assess segmentation accuracy, reasoning quality, and efficiency jointly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves both reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance. Our work contributes novel perspectives towards efficient and interpretable multimodal understanding. The code and model will be publicly available.





## ML-Agent: Reinforcing LLM Agents for Autonomous Machine Learning Engineering
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23723v1
- **Authors**: ['Zexi Liu', 'Jingyi Chai', 'Xinyu Zhu', 'Shuo Tang', 'Rui Ye', 'Bo Zhang', 'Lei Bai', 'Siheng Chen']
- **Abstrat**: The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences. Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional cross-task generalization capabilities.





## Length-Controlled Margin-Based Preference Optimization without Reference Model
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14643v2
- **Authors**: ['Gengxu Li', 'Tingyu Xia', 'Yi Chang', 'Yuan Wu']
- **Abstrat**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a widely adopted offline algorithm for preference-based reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), designed to improve training simplicity and stability by redefining reward functions. However, DPO is hindered by several limitations, including length bias, memory inefficiency, and probability degradation. To address these challenges, we propose Length-Controlled Margin-Based Preference Optimization (LMPO), a more efficient and robust alternative. LMPO introduces a uniform reference model as an upper bound for the DPO loss, enabling a more accurate approximation of the original optimization objective. Additionally, an average log-probability optimization strategy is employed to minimize discrepancies between training and inference phases. A key innovation of LMPO lies in its Length-Controlled Margin-Based loss function, integrated within the Bradley-Terry framework. This loss function regulates response length while simultaneously widening the margin between preferred and rejected outputs. By doing so, it mitigates probability degradation for both accepted and discarded responses, addressing a significant limitation of existing methods. We evaluate LMPO against state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques on two open-ended large language models, Mistral and LLaMA3, across six conditional benchmarks. Our experimental results demonstrate that LMPO effectively controls response length, reduces probability degradation, and outperforms existing approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/gengxuli/LMPO.





## FastTD3: Simple, Fast, and Capable Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Control

- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven significant progress in robotics, but its complexity and long training times remain major bottlenecks. In this report, we introduce FastTD3, a simple, fast, and capable RL algorithm that significantly speeds up training for humanoid robots in popular suites such as HumanoidBench, IsaacLab, and MuJoCo Playground. Our recipe is remarkably simple: we train an off-policy TD3 agent with several modifications -- parallel simulation, large-batch updates, a distributional critic, and carefully tuned hyperparameters. FastTD3 solves a range of HumanoidBench tasks in under 3 hours on a single A100 GPU, while remaining stable during training. We also provide a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of FastTD3 to accelerate RL research in robotics.





## AMOR: Adaptive Character Control through Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23708v1
- **Authors**: ['Lucas N. Alegre', 'Agon Serifi', 'Ruben Grandia', 'David Müller', 'Espen Knoop', 'Moritz Bächer']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the control of physics-based and robotic characters that track kinematic reference motion. However, methods typically rely on a weighted sum of conflicting reward functions, requiring extensive tuning to achieve a desired behavior. Due to the computational cost of RL, this iterative process is a tedious, time-intensive task. Furthermore, for robotics applications, the weights need to be chosen such that the policy performs well in the real world, despite inevitable sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that trains a single policy conditioned on a set of weights, spanning the Pareto front of reward trade-offs. Within this framework, weights can be selected and tuned after training, significantly speeding up iteration time. We demonstrate how this improved workflow can be used to perform highly dynamic motions with a robot character. Moreover, we explore how weight-conditioned policies can be leveraged in hierarchical settings, using a high-level policy to dynamically select weights according to the current task. We show that the multi-objective policy encodes a diverse spectrum of behaviors, facilitating efficient adaptation to novel tasks.





## Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703v1
- **Authors**: ['Ruida Wang', 'Yuxin Li', 'Yi R.', 'Fung', 'Tong Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.





## Grounded Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23678v1
- **Authors**: ['Gabriel Sarch', 'Snigdha Saha', 'Naitik Khandelwal', 'Ayush Jain', 'Michael J. Tarr', 'Aviral Kumar', 'Katerina Fragkiadaki']
- **Abstrat**: While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement Learning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces, guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds. Across a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK for spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and VisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual feedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration, grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations show that the model's visual references are not only spatially accurate but also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps. Our results show that visually grounded RL is a strong paradigm for imbuing models with general-purpose visual reasoning.





## Maximizing Confidence Alone Improves Reasoning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22660v2
- **Authors**: ['Mihir Prabhudesai', 'Lili Chen', 'Alex Ippoliti', 'Katerina Fragkiadaki', 'Hao Liu', 'Deepak Pathak']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems. However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen and Mistral families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision is unavailable.





## Fortune: Formula-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Table Reasoning in Language Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23667v1
- **Authors**: ['Lang Cao', 'Jingxian Xu', 'Hanbing Liu', 'Jinyu Wang', 'Mengyu Zhou', 'Haoyu Dong', 'Shi Han', 'Dongmei Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: Tables are a fundamental structure for organizing and analyzing data, making effective table understanding a critical capability for intelligent systems. While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks, enabling a 7B model to outperform O1 on table understanding. This highlights the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.





## AMBER: Adaptive Mesh Generation by Iterative Mesh Resolution Prediction

- **Abstrat**: The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh. Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation. Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e., a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.





## Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Model Generation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23657v1
- **Authors**: ['Hongxiang Zhang', 'Hao Chen', 'Tianyi Zhang', 'Muhao Chen']
- **Abstrat**: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models~(LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.





## YESciEval: Robust LLM-as-a-Judge for Scientific Question Answering
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14279v2
- **Authors**: ["Jennifer D'Souza", 'Hamed Babaei Giglou', 'Quentin Münch']
- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models (LLMs) drive scientific question-answering on modern search engines, yet their evaluation robustness remains underexplored. We introduce YESciEval, an open-source framework that combines fine-grained rubric-based assessment with reinforcement learning to mitigate optimism bias in LLM evaluators. We release multidisciplinary scienceQ&A datasets, including adversarial variants, with evaluation scores from multiple LLMs. Independent of proprietary models and human feedback, our approach enables scalable, cost-free evaluation. By advancing reliable LLM-as-a-judge models, this work supports AI alignment and fosters robust, transparent evaluation essential for scientific inquiry.





## Table-R1: Inference-Time Scaling for Table Reasoning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23621v1
- **Authors**: ['Zheyuan Yang', 'Lyuhao Chen', 'Arman Cohan', 'Yilun Zhao']
- **Abstrat**: In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a 7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization, as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.





## Inference-time Scaling of Diffusion Models through Classical Search

- **Authors**: ['Xiangcheng Zhang', 'Haowei Lin', 'Haotian Ye', 'James Zou', 'Jianzhu Ma', 'Yitao Liang', 'Yilun Du']
- **Abstrat**: Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models. Project page at diffusion-inference-scaling.github.io.





## Satori-SWE: Evolutionary Test-Time Scaling for Sample-Efficient Software Engineering

- **Authors**: ['Guangtao Zeng', 'Maohao Shen', 'Delin Chen', 'Zhenting Qi', 'Subhro Das', 'Dan Gutfreund', 'David Cox', 'Gregory Wornell', 'Wei Lu', 'Zhang-Wei Hong', 'Chuang Gan']
- **Abstrat**: Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one. Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.

## Wake-Informed 3D Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Using A* and Neural Network Approximations
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01918v2
- **Authors**: ['Zachary Cooper-Baldock', 'Stephen Turnock', 'Karl Sammut']
- **Abstrat**: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) encounter significant energy, control and navigation challenges in complex underwater environments, particularly during close-proximity operations, such as launch and recovery (LAR), where fluid interactions and wake effects present additional navigational and energy challenges. Traditional path planning methods fail to incorporate these detailed wake structures, resulting in increased energy consumption, reduced control stability, and heightened safety risks. This paper presents a novel wake-informed, 3D path planning approach that fully integrates localized wake effects and global currents into the planning algorithm. Two variants of the A* algorithm - a current-informed planner and a wake-informed planner - are created to assess its validity and two neural network models are then trained to approximate these planners for real-time applications. Both the A* planners and NN models are evaluated using important metrics such as energy expenditure, path length, and encounters with high-velocity and turbulent regions. The results demonstrate a wake-informed A* planner consistently achieves the lowest energy expenditure and minimizes encounters with high-velocity regions, reducing energy consumption by up to 11.3%. The neural network models are observed to offer computational speedup of 6 orders of magnitude, but exhibit 4.51 - 19.79% higher energy expenditures and 9.81 - 24.38% less optimal paths. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating detailed wake structures into traditional path planning algorithms and the benefits of neural network approximations to enhance energy efficiency and operational safety for AUVs in complex 3D domains.





## Of Mice and Machines: A Comparison of Learning Between Real World Mice and RL Agents
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12204v2
- **Authors**: ['Shuo Han', 'German Espinosa', 'Junda Huang', 'Daniel A. Dombeck', 'Malcolm A. MacIver', 'Bradly C. Stadie']
- **Abstrat**: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.





## Long Duration Inspection of GNSS-Denied Environments with a Tethered UAV-UGV Marsupial System
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23457v1
- **Authors**: ['Simón Martínez-Rozas', 'David Alejo', 'José Javier Carpio', 'Fernando Caballero', 'Luis Merino']
- **Abstrat**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools in inspection and emergency response operations due to their high maneuverability and ability to access hard-to-reach areas. However, their limited battery life significantly restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a novel tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. We detail the hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability and describe our full-stack software framework, which is composed of open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the system through three field experiments: (1) a manual flight endurance test to estimate the operational duration, (2) an autonomous navigation test, and (3) an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities. Experimental results confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system, its capacity to operate in GNSS-denied environments, and its potential for long-endurance, autonomous inspection and monitoring tasks.





## SCoTT: Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking for Wireless-Aware Robot Navigation in Digital Twins
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18212v2
- **Authors**: ['Aladin Djuhera', 'Amin Seffo', 'Vlad C. Andrei', 'Holger Boche', 'Walid Saad']
- **Abstrat**: Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge in robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into classical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this paper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and trajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a digital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive search problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought prompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and wireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance metrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive experiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while consistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate outputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving up to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs, demonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also show the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node within Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines, compute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs, underscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware navigation in real-world applications.





## DORAEMON: Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation

- **Authors**: ['Tianjun Gu', 'Linfeng Li', 'Xuhong Wang', 'Chenghua Gong', 'Jingyu Gong', 'Zhizhong Zhang', 'Yuan Xie', 'Lizhuang Ma', 'Xin Tan']
- **Abstrat**: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar environments is crucial for household service robots but remains challenging due to the need for both low-level path planning and high-level scene understanding. While recent vision-language model (VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations, and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.

- **Abstrat**: Path planning is a fundamental capability of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), enabling them to efficiently navigate toward a target region or explore complex environments while avoiding obstacles. Traditional pathplanning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have proven effective but often encounter significant challenges. These include high search space complexity, suboptimal path quality, and slow convergence, issues that are particularly problematic in high-stakes applications like disaster response, where rapid and efficient planning is critical. To address these limitations and enhance path-planning efficiency, we propose Vision Language Model RRT (VLM-RRT), a hybrid approach that integrates the pattern recognition capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the path-planning strengths of RRT. By leveraging VLMs to provide initial directional guidance based on environmental snapshots, our method biases sampling toward regions more likely to contain feasible paths, significantly improving sampling efficiency and path quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with various state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach.

- **Abstrat**: We are surrounded by robots helping us perform complex tasks. Robots have a wide range of applications, from industrial automation to personalized assistance. However, with great technological innovation come significant challenges. One of the major challenges in robotics is path planning. Despite advancements such as graph search, sampling, and potential field methods, most path planning algorithms focus either on optimality or on safety. Very little research addresses both simultaneously. We propose a Unified Path Planner (UPP) that uses modified heuristics and a dynamic safety cost function to balance safety and optimality. The level of safety can be adjusted via tunable parameters, trading off against computational complexity. We demonstrate the planner's performance in simulations, showing how parameter variation affects results. UPP is compared with various traditional and safe-optimal planning algorithms across different scenarios. We also validate it on a TurtleBot, where the robot successfully finds safe and sub-optimal paths.
