- **Authors**: ['Yiqing Xu', 'Finale Doshi-Velez', 'David Hsu']
- **Abstrat**: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms often rely on (forward) reinforcement learning or planning over a given time horizon to compute an approximately optimal policy for a hypothesized reward function and then match this policy with expert demonstrations. The time horizon plays a critical role in determining both the accuracy of reward estimates and the computational efficiency of IRL algorithms. Interestingly, an \emph{effective time horizon} shorter than the ground-truth value often produces better results faster. This work formally analyzes this phenomenon and provides an explanation: the time horizon controls the complexity of an induced policy class and mitigates overfitting with limited data. This analysis serves as a guide for the principled choice of the effective horizon for IRL. It also prompts us to re-examine the classic IRL formulation: it is more natural to learn jointly the reward and the effective horizon rather than the reward alone with a given horizon. To validate our findings, we implement a cross-validation extension and the experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis.

- **Abstrat**: Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (RVD) have been extensively studied in recent years, addressing the stringent requirements of spacecraft dynamics variations and the limitations of GNC systems. This paper presents an innovative approach employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) trained through Reinforcement Learning (RL) for autonomous spacecraft guidance and control during the final phase of the rendezvous maneuver. The proposed strategy is easily implementable onboard and offers fast adaptability and robustness to disturbances by learning control policies from experience rather than relying on predefined models. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations within a relevant environment are conducted in 6DoF settings to validate our approach, along with hardware tests that demonstrate deployment feasibility. Our findings highlight the efficacy of RL in assuring the adaptability and efficiency of spacecraft RVD, offering insights into future mission expectations.

- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning combined with sim-to-real transfer offers a general framework for developing locomotion controllers for legged robots. To facilitate successful deployment in the real world, smoothing techniques, such as low-pass filters and smoothness rewards, are often employed to develop policies with smooth behaviors. However, because these techniques are non-differentiable and usually require tedious tuning of a large set of hyperparameters, they tend to require extensive manual tuning for each robotic platform. To address this challenge and establish a general technique for enforcing smooth behaviors, we propose a simple and effective method that imposes a Lipschitz constraint on a learned policy, which we refer to as Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP). We show that the Lipschitz constraint can be implemented in the form of a gradient penalty, which provides a differentiable objective that can be easily incorporated with automatic differentiation frameworks. We demonstrate that LCP effectively replaces the need for smoothing rewards or low-pass filters and can be easily integrated into training frameworks for many distinct humanoid robots. We extensively evaluate LCP in both simulation and real-world humanoid robots, producing smooth and robust locomotion controllers. All simulation and deployment code, along with complete checkpoints, is available on our project page: https://lipschitz-constrained-policy.github.io.





## Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs

- **Abstrat**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.





## Energy-Efficient Computation with DVFS using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Task Systems in Edge Computing
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19434v2
- **Authors**: ['Xinyi Li', 'Ti Zhou', 'Haoyu Wang', 'Man Lin']
- **Abstrat**: Periodic soft real-time systems have broad applications in many areas, such as IoT. Finding an optimal energy-efficient policy that is adaptable to underlying edge devices while meeting deadlines for tasks has always been challenging. This research studies generalized systems with multi-task, multi-deadline scenarios with reinforcement learning-based DVFS for energy saving. This work addresses the limitation of previous work that models a periodic system as a single task and single-deadline scenario, which is too simplified to cope with complex situations. The method encodes time series information in the Linux kernel into information that is easy to use for reinforcement learning, allowing the system to generate DVFS policies to adapt system patterns based on the general workload. For encoding, we present two different methods for comparison. Both methods use only one performance counter: system utilization and the kernel only needs minimal information from the userspace. Our method is implemented on Jetson Nano Board (2GB) and is tested with three fixed multitask workloads, which are three, five, and eight tasks in the workload, respectively. For randomness and generalization, we also designed a random workload generator to build different multitask workloads to test. Based on the test results, our method could save 3%-10% power compared to Linux built-in governors.





## Dynamic Learning Rate for Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Bandit Approach
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12598v1
- **Authors**: ['Henrique Don√¢ncio', 'Antoine Barrier', 'Leah F. South', 'Florence Forbes']
- **Abstrat**: In Deep Reinforcement Learning models trained using gradient-based techniques, the choice of optimizer and its learning rate are crucial to achieving good performance: higher learning rates can prevent the model from learning effectively, while lower ones might slow convergence. Additionally, due to the non-stationarity of the objective function, the best-performing learning rate can change over the training steps. To adapt the learning rate, a standard technique consists of using decay schedulers. However, these schedulers assume that the model is progressively approaching convergence, which may not always be true, leading to delayed or premature adjustments. In this work, we propose dynamic Learning Rate for deep Reinforcement Learning (LRRL), a meta-learning approach that selects the learning rate based on the agent's performance during training. LRRL is based on a multi-armed bandit algorithm, where each arm represents a different learning rate, and the bandit feedback is provided by the cumulative returns of the RL policy to update the arms' probability distribution. Our empirical results demonstrate that LRRL can substantially improve the performance of deep RL algorithms.





## Data Augmentation for Continual RL via Adversarial Gradient Episodic Memory
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13452v3
- **Authors**: ['Sihao Wu', 'Xingyu Zhao', 'Xiaowei Huang']
- **Abstrat**: Data efficiency of learning, which plays a key role in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) training process, becomes even more important in continual RL with sequential environments. In continual RL, the learner interacts with non-stationary, sequential tasks and is required to learn new tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. However, there is little work on implementing data augmentation for continual RL. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of data augmentation for continual RL. Specifically, we provide benchmarking data augmentations for continual RL, by (1) summarising existing data augmentation methods and (2) including a new augmentation method for continual RL: Adversarial Augmentation with Gradient Episodic Memory (Adv-GEM). Extensive experiments show that data augmentations, such as random amplitude scaling, state-switch, mixup, adversarial augmentation, and Adv-GEM, can improve existing continual RL algorithms in terms of their average performance, catastrophic forgetting, and forward transfer, on robot control tasks. All data augmentation methods are implemented as plug-in modules for trivial integration into continual RL methods.





## Robust RL with LLM-Driven Data Synthesis and Policy Adaptation for Autonomous Driving
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12568v1
- **Authors**: ['Sihao Wu', 'Jiaxu Liu', 'Xiangyu Yin', 'Guangliang Cheng', 'Meng Fang', 'Xingyu Zhao', 'Xinping Yi', 'Xiaowei Huang']
- **Abstrat**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving systems demonstrates strong common sense and reasoning abilities, effectively addressing the pitfalls of purely data-driven methods. Current LLM-based agents require lengthy inference times and face challenges in interacting with real-time autonomous driving environments. A key open question is whether we can effectively leverage the knowledge from LLMs to train an efficient and robust Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This paper introduces RAPID, a novel \underline{\textbf{R}}obust \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive \underline{\textbf{P}}olicy \underline{\textbf{I}}nfusion and \underline{\textbf{D}}istillation framework, which trains specialized mix-of-policy RL agents using data synthesized by an LLM-based driving agent and online adaptation. RAPID features three key designs: 1) utilization of offline data collected from an LLM agent to distil expert knowledge into RL policies for faster real-time inference; 2) introduction of robust distillation in RL to inherit both performance and robustness from LLM-based teacher; and 3) employment of a mix-of-policy approach for joint decision decoding with a policy adapter. Through fine-tuning via online environment interaction, RAPID reduces the forgetting of LLM knowledge while maintaining adaptability to different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate RAPID's capability to effectively integrate LLM knowledge into scaled-down RL policies in an efficient, adaptable, and robust way. Code and checkpoints will be made publicly available upon acceptance.





## Spectrum Sharing using Deep Reinforcement Learning in Vehicular Networks
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12521v1
- **Authors**: ['Riya Dinesh Deshpande', 'Faheem A. Khan', 'Qasim Zeeshan Ahmed']
- **Abstrat**: As the number of devices getting connected to the vehicular network grows exponentially, addressing the numerous challenges of effectively allocating spectrum in dynamic vehicular environment becomes increasingly difficult. Traditional methods may not suffice to tackle this issue. In vehicular networks safety critical messages are involved and it is important to implement an efficient spectrum allocation paradigm for hassle free communication as well as manage the congestion in the network. To tackle this, a Deep Q Network (DQN) model is proposed as a solution, leveraging its ability to learn optimal strategies over time and make decisions. The paper presents a few results and analyses, demonstrating the efficacy of the DQN model in enhancing spectrum sharing efficiency. Deep Reinforcement Learning methods for sharing spectrum in vehicular networks have shown promising outcomes, demonstrating the system's ability to adjust to dynamic communication environments. Both SARL and MARL models have exhibited successful rates of V2V communication, with the cumulative reward of the RL model reaching its maximum as training progresses.





## Insights from the Inverse: Reconstructing LLM Training Goals Through Inverse RL
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12491v1
- **Authors**: ['Jared Joselowitz', 'Arjun Jagota', 'Satyapriya Krishna', 'Sonali Parbhoo']
- **Abstrat**: Large language models (LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their underlying reward functions and decision-making processes remain opaque. This paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. We conduct experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting reward models that achieve up to 80.40% accuracy in predicting human preferences. Our analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of reward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and potential pitfalls in the RLHF process. We demonstrate that IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved performance on toxicity benchmarks. This work provides a new lens for understanding and improving LLM alignment, with implications for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful systems.





## SAC-GLAM: Improving Online RL for LLM agents with Soft Actor-Critic and Hindsight Relabeling

- **Authors**: ['Loris Gaven', 'Clement Romac', 'Thomas Carta', 'Sylvain Lamprier', 'Olivier Sigaud', 'Pierre-Yves Oudeyer']
- **Abstrat**: The past years have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) strive not only as generative models but also as agents solving textual sequential decision-making tasks. When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.





## Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12457v1
- **Authors**: ['Feiyang Ye', 'Yueming Lyu', 'Xuehao Wang', 'Masashi Sugiyama', 'Yu Zhang', 'Ivor Tsang']
- **Abstrat**: Black-box optimization algorithms have been widely used in various machine learning problems, including reinforcement learning and prompt fine-tuning. However, directly optimizing the training loss value, as commonly done in existing black-box optimization methods, could lead to suboptimal model quality and generalization performance. To address those problems in black-box optimization, we propose a novel Sharpness-Aware Black-box Optimization (SABO) algorithm, which applies a sharpness-aware minimization strategy to improve the model generalization. Specifically, the proposed SABO method first reparameterizes the objective function by its expectation over a Gaussian distribution. Then it iteratively updates the parameterized distribution by approximated stochastic gradients of the maximum objective value within a small neighborhood around the current solution in the Gaussian distribution space. Theoretically, we prove the convergence rate and generalization bound of the proposed SABO algorithm. Empirically, extensive experiments on the black-box prompt fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SABO method in improving model generalization performance.





## Revisiting Benchmark and Assessment: An Agent-based Exploratory Dynamic Evaluation Framework for LLMs
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11507v2
- **Authors**: ['Wanying Wang', 'Zeyu Ma', 'Pengfei Liu', 'Mingang Chen']
- **Abstrat**: While various vertical domain large language models (LLMs) have been developed, the challenge of automatically evaluating their performance across different domains remains significant. Current benchmark-based evaluation methods exhibit rigid, aimless interactions and rely on pre-collected static datasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned with practical user needs. To address this issue, we revisit the evaluation components and introduce two concepts: Benchmark+, which extends traditional question-answer benchmark into a more flexible "strategy-criterion" format; and Assessment+, which enhances the interaction process, enabling deeper exploration and supporting both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights. These concepts capture the nuanced behaviors of LLMs through richer, multi-turn interactions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called TestAgent, which implements these concepts through retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing vertical domain evaluation to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TestAgent across various scenarios. We believe this work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs.





## Designing, Developing, and Validating Network Intelligence for Scaling in Service-Based Architectures based on Deep Reinforcement Learning

- **Abstrat**: Automating network processes without human intervention is crucial for the complex Sixth Generation (6G) environment. Thus, 6G networks must advance beyond basic automation, relying on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for self-optimizing and autonomous operation. This requires zero-touch management and orchestration, the integration of Network Intelligence (NI) into the network architecture, and the efficient lifecycle management of intelligent functions. Despite its potential, integrating NI poses challenges in model development and application. To tackle those issues, this paper presents a novel methodology to manage the complete lifecycle of Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in networking, thereby enhancing existing Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) frameworks to accommodate RL-specific tasks. We focus on scaling computing resources in service-based architectures, modeling the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Two RL algorithms, guided by distinct Reward Functions (RFns), are proposed to autonomously determine the number of service replicas in dynamic environments. Our proposed methodology is anchored on a dual approach: firstly, it evaluates the training performance of these algorithms under varying RFns, and secondly, it validates their performance after being trained to discern the practical applicability in real-world settings. We show that, despite significant progress, the development stage of RL techniques for networking applications, particularly in scaling scenarios, still leaves room for significant improvements. This study underscores the importance of ongoing research and development to enhance the practicality and resilience of RL techniques in real-world networking environments.





## Parallel Momentum Methods Under Biased Gradient Estimations
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00853v2
- **Authors**: ['Ali Beikmohammadi', 'Sarit Khirirat', 'Sindri Magn√∫sson']
- **Abstrat**: Parallel stochastic gradient methods are gaining prominence in solving large-scale machine learning problems that involve data distributed across multiple nodes. However, obtaining unbiased stochastic gradients, which have been the focus of most theoretical research, is challenging in many distributed machine learning applications. The gradient estimations easily become biased, for example, when gradients are compressed or clipped, when data is shuffled, and in meta-learning and reinforcement learning. In this work, we establish worst-case bounds on parallel momentum methods under biased gradient estimation on both general non-convex and $\mu$-PL problems. Our analysis covers general distributed optimization problems, and we work out the implications for special cases where gradient estimates are biased, i.e. in meta-learning and when the gradients are compressed or clipped. Our numerical experiments verify our theoretical findings and show faster convergence performance of momentum methods than traditional biased gradient descent.





## AoI-Aware Resource Allocation for Smart Multi-QoS Provisioning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12384v1
- **Authors**: ['Jingqing Wang', 'Wenchi Cheng', 'Wei Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: The Age of Information (AoI) has recently gained recognition as a critical quality-of-service (QoS) metric for quantifying the freshness of status updates, playing a crucial role in supporting massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (mURLLC) services. In mURLLC scenarios, due to the inherent system dynamics and varying environmental conditions, optimizing AoI under such multi-QoS constraints considering both delay and reliability often results in non-convex and computationally intractable problems. Motivated by the demonstrated efficacy of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in addressing large-scale networking challenges, this work aims to apply DRL techniques to derive optimal resource allocation solutions in real time. Despite its potential, the effective integration of FBC in DRL-based AoI optimization remains underexplored, especially in addressing the challenge of simultaneously upper-bounding both delay and error-rate. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based framework for AoI-aware optimal resource allocation in mURLLC-driven multi-QoS schemes, leveraging AoI as a core metric within the finite blocklength regime. First, we design a wireless communication architecture and AoI-based modeling framework that incorporates FBC. Second, we proceed by deriving upper-bounded peak AoI and delay violation probabilities using stochastic network calculus (SNC). Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the peak AoI violation probability through FBC. Third, we develop DRL algorithms to determine optimal resource allocation policies that meet statistical delay and error-rate requirements for mURLLC. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the developed schemes, we have executed a series of simulations.





## PRefLexOR: Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning and Agentic Thinking
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12375v1
- **Authors**: ['Markus J. Buehler']
- **Abstrat**: PRefLexOR (Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning) combines preference optimization with concepts from Reinforcement Learning to enable models to self-teach through iterative reasoning improvements. We propose a recursive learning approach that engages the model in multi-step reasoning, revisiting, and refining intermediate steps before producing a final output in training and inference phases. Through multiple training stages, the model first learns to align its reasoning with accurate decision paths by optimizing the log odds between preferred and non-preferred responses. During this process, PRefLexOR builds a dynamic knowledge graph by generating questions from random text chunks and retrieval-augmentation to contextualize relevant details from the entire training corpus. In the second stage, preference optimization enhances model performance by using rejection sampling to fine-tune reasoning quality by continually producing in-situ training data while masking the reasoning steps. Recursive optimization within a thinking token framework introduces iterative feedback loops, where the model refines reasoning, achieving deeper coherence, consistency, and adaptability. Implemented in small language models with only 3 billion parameters, we should that even tiny models can iteratively teach themselves to reason with greater depth and reflectivity. Our implementation is straightforward and can be incorporated into any existing pretrained LLM. We focus our examples on applications in biological materials science and demonstrate the method in a variety of case studies that range from in-domain to cross-domain applications. Using reasoning strategies that include thinking and reflection modalities we build a multi-agent recursive self-improving inference approach to successively improve responses via repeated sampling in inference time.





## GAN Based Top-Down View Synthesis in Reinforcement Learning Environments
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12372v1
- **Authors**: ['Usama Younus', 'Vinoj Jayasundara', 'Shivam Mishra', 'Suleyman Aslan']
- **Abstrat**: Human actions are based on the mental perception of the environment. Even when all the aspects of an environment are not visible, humans have an internal mental model that can generalize the partially visible scenes to fully constructed and connected views. This internal mental model uses learned abstract representations of spatial and temporal aspects of the environments encountered in the past.   Artificial agents in reinforcement learning environments also benefit by learning a representation of the environment from experience. It provides the agent with viewpoints that are not directly visible to it, helping it make better policy decisions. It can also be used to predict the future state of the environment.   This project explores learning the top-down view of an RL environment based on the artificial agent's first-person view observations with a generative adversarial network(GAN). The top-down view is useful as it provides a complete overview of the environment by building a map of the entire environment. It provides information about the objects' dimensions and shapes along with their relative positions with one another. Initially, when only a partial observation of the environment is visible to the agent, only a partial top-down view is generated. As the agent explores the environment through a set of actions, the generated top-down view becomes complete. This generated top-down view can assist the agent in deducing better policy decisions. The focus of the project is to learn the top-down view of an RL environment. It doesn't deal with any Reinforcement Learning task.





## Understanding What Affects the Generalization Gap in Visual Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Empirical Evidence
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02701v2
- **Authors**: ['Jiafei Lyu', 'Le Wan', 'Xiu Li', 'Zongqing Lu']
- **Abstrat**: Recently, there are many efforts attempting to learn useful policies for continuous control in visual reinforcement learning (RL). In this scenario, it is important to learn a generalizable policy, as the testing environment may differ from the training environment, e.g., there exist distractors during deployment. Many practical algorithms are proposed to handle this problem. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provide a theoretical understanding of what affects the generalization gap and why their proposed methods work. In this paper, we bridge this issue by theoretically answering the key factors that contribute to the generalization gap when the testing environment has distractors. Our theories indicate that minimizing the representation distance between training and testing environments, which aligns with human intuition, is the most critical for the benefit of reducing the generalization gap. Our theoretical results are supported by the empirical evidence in the DMControl Generalization Benchmark (DMC-GB).

- **Abstrat**: Program-of-Thought (PoT) replaces natural language-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as the most popular method in Large Language Models (LLMs) mathematical reasoning tasks by utilizing external tool calls to circumvent computational errors. However, our evaluation of the GPT-4 and Llama series reveals that using PoT introduces more reasoning errors, such as incorrect formulas or flawed logic, compared to CoT. To address this issue, we propose Human-Think Language (HTL), which leverages a suite of strategies that help integrate PoT and CoT, encompassing: (1) a new generation paradigm that uses full CoT reasoning to control code generation. (2) Focus Attention, that directs model attention to the CoT reasoning during PoT to generate more logical code. (3) reinforcement learning that utilizes the accuracy of both CoT and PoT responses as rewards to prevent repetitive reasoning steps in LLMs when solving difficult math problems. Our method achieves an average improvement of 6.5% on the Llama-Base model and 4.3% on the Mistral-Base model across 8 mathematical calculation datasets. It also shows significant effectiveness on five out-of-domain datasets by controlling the model's information flow, exhibiting strong transferability. Additionally, HTL shows the most significant improvement in non-mathematical natural language inference task, contributing to a unified reasoning task framework

## An efficient strategy for path planning with a tethered marsupial robotics system
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02141v2
- **Authors**: ['Jes√∫s Capit√°n', 'Jos√© M. D√≠az-B√°√±ez', 'Miguel A. P√©rez-Cuti√±o', 'Fabio Rodr√≠guez', 'Inmaculada Ventura']
- **Abstrat**: A tethered marsupial robotics system comprises three components: an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and a tether connecting both robots. Marsupial systems are highly beneficial in industry as they extend the UAV's battery life during flight. This paper introduces a novel strategy for a specific path planning problem in marsupial systems, where each of the three components must avoid collisions with ground and aerial obstacles modeled as 3D cuboids. Given an initial configuration in which the UAV is positioned atop the UGV, the goal is to reach an aerial target with the UAV. We assume that the UGV first moves to a position from which the UAV can take off and fly through a vertical plane to reach an aerial target. We propose an approach that discretizes the space to approximate an optimal solution, minimizing the sum of the lengths of the ground and air paths. First, we assume a taut tether and use a novel algorithm that leverages the convexity of the tether and the geometry of obstacles to efficiently determine the locus of feasible take-off points for the UAV. We then apply this result to scenarios that involve loose tethers. The simulation test results show that our approach can solve complex situations in seconds, outperforming a baseline planning algorithm based on RRT* (Rapidly exploring Random Trees).





## Orienteering (with Time Windows) on Restricted Graph Classes
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12401v1
- **Authors**: ['Kevin Buchin', 'Mart Hagedoorn', 'Guangping Li', 'Carolin Rehs']
- **Abstrat**: Given a graph with edge costs and vertex profits and given a budget B, the Orienteering Problem asks for a walk of cost at most B of maximum profit. Additionally, each profit may be given with a time window within it can be collected by the walk.   While the Orienteering Problem and thus the version with time windows are NP-hard in general, it remains open on numerous special graph classes. Since in several applications, especially for planning a route from A to B with waypoints, the input graph can be restricted to tree-like or path-like structures, in this paper we consider orienteering on these graph classes.   While the Orienteering Problem with time windows is NP-hard even on undirected paths and cycles, and remains so even if all profits must be collected, we show that for directed paths it can be solved efficiently, even if each profit can be collected in one of several time windows. The same case is shown to be NP-hard for directed cycles.   Particularly interesting is the Orienteering Problem on a directed cycle with one time window per profit. We give an efficient algorithm for the case where all time windows are shorter than the length of the cycle, resulting in a 2-approximation for the general setting. We further develop a polynomial-time approximation scheme for this problem and give a polynomial algorithm for the case where all profits must be collected.   For the Orienteering Problem with time windows for the edges, we give a quadratic time algorithm for undirected paths and observe that the problem is NP-hard for trees.   In the variant without time windows, we show that on trees and thus on graphs with bounded tree-width the Orienteering Problem remains NP-hard. We present, however, an FPT algorithm to solve orienteering with unit profits that we then use to obtain a ($1+\varepsilon$)-approximation algorithm on graphs with arbitrary profits and bounded tree-width.
