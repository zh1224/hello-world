- **Abstrat**: Humanoid robots derive much of their dexterity from hyper-dexterous whole-body movements, enabling tasks that require a large operational workspace: such as picking objects off the ground. However, achieving these capabilities on real humanoids remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom (DoF) and nonlinear dynamics. We propose Adaptive Motion Optimization (AMO), a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) with trajectory optimization for real-time, adaptive whole-body control. To mitigate distribution bias in motion imitation RL, we construct a hybrid AMO dataset and train a network capable of robust, on-demand adaptation to potentially O.O.D. commands. We validate AMO in simulation and on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating superior stability and an expanded workspace compared to strong baselines. Finally, we show that AMO's consistent performance supports autonomous task execution via imitation learning, underscoring the system's versatility and robustness.

- **Abstrat**: Solar sensor-based monitoring systems have become a crucial agricultural innovation, advancing farm management and animal welfare through integrating sensor technology, Internet-of-Things, and edge and cloud computing. However, the resilience of these systems to cyber-attacks and their adaptability to dynamic and constrained energy supplies remain largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a sustainable smart farm network designed to maintain high-quality animal monitoring under various cyber and adversarial threats, as well as fluctuating energy conditions. Our approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to devise optimal policies that maximize both monitoring effectiveness and energy efficiency. To overcome DRL's inherent challenge of slow convergence, we integrate transfer learning (TL) and decision theory (DT) to accelerate the learning process. By incorporating DT-guided strategies, we optimize monitoring quality and energy sustainability, significantly reducing training time while achieving comparable performance rewards. Our experimental results prove that DT-guided DRL outperforms TL-enhanced DRL models, improving system performance and reducing training runtime by 47.5%.

This survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy of HMT, analyzing theoretical models, including reinforcement learning, instance-based learning, and interdependence theory, alongside interdisciplinary methodologies. Unlike prior reviews, we examine team cognition, ethical AI, multi-modal interactions, and real-world evaluation frameworks. Key challenges include explainability, role allocation, and scalable benchmarking. We propose future research in cross-domain adaptation, trust-aware AI, and standardized testbeds. By bridging computational and social sciences, this work lays a foundation for resilient, ethical, and scalable HMT systems.





## Actor-Critics Can Achieve Optimal Sample Efficiency
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03710v1
- **Authors**: ['Kevin Tan', 'Wei Fan', 'Yuting Wei']
- **Abstrat**: Actor-critic algorithms have become a cornerstone in reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging the strengths of both policy-based and value-based methods. Despite recent progress in understanding their statistical efficiency, no existing work has successfully learned an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ trajectories with general function approximation when strategic exploration is necessary.   We address this open problem by introducing a novel actor-critic algorithm that attains a sample-complexity of $O(dH^5 \log|\mathcal{A}|/\epsilon^2 + d H^4 \log|\mathcal{F}|/ \epsilon^2)$ trajectories, and accompanying $\sqrt{T}$ regret when the Bellman eluder dimension $d$ does not increase with $T$ at more than a $\log T$ rate.   Here, $\mathcal{F}$ is the critic function class, $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, and $H$ is the horizon in the finite horizon MDP setting. Our algorithm integrates optimism, off-policy critic estimation targeting the optimal Q-function, and rare-switching policy resets.   We extend this to the setting of Hybrid RL, showing that initializing the critic with offline data yields sample efficiency gains compared to purely offline or online RL. Further, utilizing access to offline data, we provide a \textit{non-optimistic} provably efficient actor-critic algorithm that only additionally requires $N_{\text{off}} \geq c_{\text{off}}^*dH^4/\epsilon^2$ in exchange for omitting optimism, where $c_{\text{off}}^*$ is the single-policy concentrability coefficient and $N_{\text{off}}$ is the number of offline samples. This addresses another open problem in the literature. We further provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.





## Policy Gradient Adaptive Control for the LQR: Indirect and Direct Approaches
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03706v1
- **Authors**: ['Feiran Zhao', 'Alessandro Chiuso', 'Florian DÃ¶rfler']
- **Abstrat**: Motivated by recent advances of reinforcement learning and direct data-driven control, we propose policy gradient adaptive control (PGAC) for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), which uses online closed-loop data to improve the control policy while maintaining stability. Our method adaptively updates the policy in feedback by descending the gradient of the LQR cost and is categorized as indirect, when gradients are computed via an estimated model, versus direct, when gradients are derived from data using sample covariance parameterization. Beyond the vanilla gradient, we also showcase the merits of the natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods for the policy update. Notably, natural gradient descent bridges the indirect and direct PGAC, and the Gauss-Newton method of the indirect PGAC leads to an adaptive version of the celebrated Hewer's algorithm. To account for the uncertainty from noise, we propose a regularization method for both indirect and direct PGAC. For all the considered PGAC approaches, we show closed-loop stability and convergence of the policy to the optimal LQR gain. Simulations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness and computational efficiency of PGAC.





## Efficient Diversity-Preserving Diffusion Alignment via Gradient-Informed GFlowNets
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07775v5
- **Authors**: ['Zhen Liu', 'Tim Z. Xiao', 'Weiyang Liu', 'Yoshua Bengio', 'Dinghuai Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: While one commonly trains large diffusion models by collecting datasets on target downstream tasks, it is often desired to align and finetune pretrained diffusion models with some reward functions that are either designed by experts or learned from small-scale datasets. Existing post-training methods for reward finetuning of diffusion models typically suffer from lack of diversity in generated samples, lack of prior preservation, and/or slow convergence in finetuning. In response to this challenge, we take inspiration from recent successes in generative flow networks (GFlowNets) and propose a reinforcement learning method for diffusion model finetuning, dubbed Nabla-GFlowNet (abbreviated as $\nabla$-GFlowNet), that leverages the rich signal in reward gradients for probabilistic diffusion finetuning. We show that our proposed method achieves fast yet diversity- and prior-preserving finetuning of Stable Diffusion, a large-scale text-conditioned image diffusion model, on different realistic reward functions.





## An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14131v3
- **Authors**: ['Enoch H. Kang', 'Hema Yoganarasimhan', 'Lalit Jain']
- **Abstrat**: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.





## A Synergistic Framework of Nonlinear Acoustic Computing and Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Human-Robot Interaction
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01998v2
- **Authors**: ['Xiaoliang Chen', 'Xin Yu', 'Le Chang', 'Yunhe Huang', 'Jiashuai He', 'Shibo Zhang', 'Jin Li', 'Likai Lin', 'Ziyu Zeng', 'Xianling Tu', 'Shuyu Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: This paper introduces a novel framework integrating nonlinear acoustic computing and reinforcement learning to enhance advanced human-robot interaction under complex noise and reverberation. Leveraging physically informed wave equations (e.g., Westervelt, KZK), the approach captures higher-order phenomena such as harmonic generation and shock formation. By embedding these models in a reinforcement learning-driven control loop, the system adaptively optimizes key parameters (e.g., absorption, beamforming) to mitigate multipath interference and non-stationary noise. Experimental evaluations, covering far-field localization, weak signal detection, and multilingual speech recognition, demonstrate that this hybrid strategy surpasses traditional linear methods and purely data-driven baselines, achieving superior noise suppression, minimal latency, and robust accuracy in demanding real-world scenarios. The proposed system demonstrates broad application prospects in AI hardware, robot, machine audition, artificial audition, and brain-machine interfaces.





## Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control for Adaptive Control of Hydrogen-Diesel Dual-Fuel Combustion
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16875v2
- **Authors**: ['Julian Bedei', 'Murray McBain', 'Alexander Winkler', 'Charles Robert Koch', 'Jakob Andert', 'David Gordon']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning Integrated Model Predictive Control (ML-MPC) are promising approaches for optimizing hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel engine control, as they can effectively control multiple-input multiple-output systems and nonlinear processes. ML-MPC is advantageous for providing safe and optimal controls, ensuring the engine operates within predefined safety limits. In contrast, RL is distinguished by its adaptability to changing conditions through its learning-based approach. However, the practical implementation of either method alone poses challenges. RL requires high variance in control inputs during early learning phases, which can pose risks to the system by potentially executing unsafe actions, leading to mechanical damage. Conversely, ML-MPC relies on an accurate system model to generate optimal control inputs and has limited adaptability to system drifts, such as injector aging, which naturally occur in engine applications. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid RL and ML-MPC approach that uses an ML-MPC framework while incorporating an RL agent to dynamically adjust the ML-MPC load tracking reference in response to changes in the environment. At the same time, the ML-MPC ensures that actions stay safe throughout the RL agent's exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, fuel pressure is deliberately varied to introduce a model-plant mismatch between the ML-MPC and the engine test bench. The result of this mismatch is a root mean square error (RMSE) in indicated mean effective pressure of 0.57 bar when running the ML-MPC. The experimental results demonstrate that RL successfully adapts to changing boundary conditions by altering the tracking reference while ML-MPC ensures safe control inputs. The quantitative improvement in load tracking by implementing RL is an RSME of 0.44 bar.





## FGAIF: Aligning Large Vision-Language Models with Fine-grained AI Feedback
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05046v2
- **Authors**: ['Liqiang Jing', 'Xinya Du']
- **Abstrat**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in tackling a variety of visual-language tasks. However, current LVLMs suffer from misalignment between text and image modalities which causes three kinds of hallucination problems, i.e., object existence, object attribute, and object relationship. To tackle this issue, existing methods mainly utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) to align modalities in LVLMs. However, they still suffer from three main limitations: (1) General feedback can not indicate the hallucination type contained in the response; (2) Sparse rewards only give the sequence-level reward for the whole response; and (3)Annotation cost is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To handle these limitations, we propose an innovative method to align modalities in LVLMs through Fine-Grained Artificial Intelligence Feedback (FGAIF), which mainly consists of three steps: AI-based Feedback Collection, Fine-grained Reward Model Training, and Reinforcement Learning with Fine-grained Reward. Specifically, We first utilize AI tools to predict the types of hallucination for each segment in the response and obtain a collection of fine-grained feedback. Then, based on the collected reward data, three specialized reward models are trained to produce dense rewards. Finally, a novel fine-grained feedback module is integrated into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on hallucination and general benchmarks, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed method. Notably, compared with previous models trained with the RL-based aligning method, our proposed method is effective even with fewer parameters.





## SAPIENT: Mastering Multi-turn Conversational Recommendation with Strategic Planning and Monte Carlo Tree Search
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09580v2
- **Authors**: ['Hanwen Du', 'Bo Peng', 'Xia Ning']
- **Abstrat**: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) proactively engage users in interactive dialogues to elicit user preferences and provide personalized recommendations. Existing methods train Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based agent with greedy action selection or sampling strategy, and may suffer from suboptimal conversational planning. To address this, we present a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based CRS framework SAPIENT. SAPIENT consists of a conversational agent (S-agent) and a conversational planner (S-planner). S-planner builds a conversational search tree with MCTS based on the initial actions proposed by S-agent to find conversation plans. The best conversation plans from S-planner are used to guide the training of S-agent, creating a self-training loop where S-agent can iteratively improve its capability for conversational planning. Furthermore, we propose an efficient variant SAPIENT-e for trade-off between training efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that SAPIENT outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.





## Bellman Unbiasedness: Tractable and Provably Efficient Distributional Reinforcement Learning with General Value Function Approximation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21260v2
- **Authors**: ['Taehyun Cho', 'Seungyub Han', 'Kyungjae Lee', 'Seokhun Ju', 'Dohyeong Kim', 'Jungwoo Lee']
- **Abstrat**: Distributional reinforcement learning improves performance by capturing environmental stochasticity, but a comprehensive theoretical understanding of its effectiveness remains elusive. In addition, the intractable element of the infinite dimensionality of distributions has been overlooked. In this paper, we present a regret analysis of distributional reinforcement learning with general value function approximation in a finite episodic Markov decision process setting. We first introduce a key notion of $\textit{Bellman unbiasedness}$ which is essential for exactly learnable and provably efficient distributional updates in an online manner. Among all types of statistical functionals for representing infinite-dimensional return distributions, our theoretical results demonstrate that only moment functionals can exactly capture the statistical information. Secondly, we propose a provably efficient algorithm, $\texttt{SF-LSVI}$, that achieves a tight regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d_E H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{K})$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $d_E$ is the eluder dimension of a function class.





## Rainbow Delay Compensation: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Mitigating Delayed Observation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03586v1
- **Authors**: ['Songchen Fu', 'Siang Chen', 'Shaojing Zhao', 'Letian Bai', 'Ta Li', 'Yonghong Yan']
- **Abstrat**: In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous, preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state. An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment. These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalization capability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.





## Ergodic Generative Flows

- **Authors**: ['Leo Maxime Brunswic', 'Mateo Clemente', 'Rui Heng Yang', 'Adam Sigal', 'Amir Rasouli', 'Yinchuan Li']
- **Abstrat**: Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) were initially introduced on directed acyclic graphs to sample from an unnormalized distribution density. Recent works have extended the theoretical framework for generative methods allowing more flexibility and enhancing application range. However, many challenges remain in training GFNs in continuous settings and for imitation learning (IL), including intractability of flow-matching loss, limited tests of non-acyclic training, and the need for a separate reward model in imitation learning. The present work proposes a family of generative flows called Ergodic Generative Flows (EGFs) which are used to address the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage ergodicity to build simple generative flows with finitely many globally defined transformations (diffeomorphisms) with universality guarantees and tractable flow-matching loss (FM loss). Second, we introduce a new loss involving cross-entropy coupled to weak flow-matching control, coined KL-weakFM loss. It is designed for IL training without a separate reward model. We evaluate IL-EGFs on toy 2D tasks and real-world datasets from NASA on the sphere, using the KL-weakFM loss. Additionally, we conduct toy 2D reinforcement learning experiments with a target reward, using the FM loss.





## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Scheduling to Support Low Latency in Teleoperated Driving
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03558v1
- **Authors**: ['Giacomo Avanzi', 'Marco Giordani', 'Michele Zorzi']
- **Abstrat**: The teleoperated driving (TD) scenario comes with stringent Quality of Service (QoS) communication constraints, especially in terms of end-to-end (E2E) latency and reliability. In this context, Predictive Quality of Service (PQoS), possibly combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, is a powerful tool to estimate QoS degradation and react accordingly. For example, an intelligent agent can be trained to select the optimal compression configuration for automotive data, and reduce the file size whenever QoS conditions deteriorate. However, compression may inevitably compromise data quality, with negative implications for the TD application. An alternative strategy involves operating at the Radio Access Network (RAN) level to optimize radio parameters based on current network conditions, while preserving data quality. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) scheduling algorithms, based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to dynamically and intelligently allocate radio resources to minimize E2E latency in a TD scenario. We evaluate two training paradigms, i.e., decentralized learning with local observations (IPPO) vs. centralized aggregation (MAPPO), in conjunction with two resource allocation strategies, i.e., proportional allocation (PA) and greedy allocation (GA). We prove via ns-3 simulations that MAPPO, combined with GA, achieves the best results in terms of latency, especially as the number of vehicles increases.





## HAIR: Hardness-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Introspective Reasoning for LLM Alignment
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18991v2
- **Authors**: ['Ruoxi Cheng', 'Haoxuan Ma', 'Weixin Wang']
- **Abstrat**: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values remains critical yet hindered by four key challenges: (1) scarcity of balanced safety datasets, (2) alignment tax, (3) vulnerability to jailbreak attacks due to shallow alignment, and (4) inability to dynamically adapt rewards according to task difficulty. To address these limitations, we introduce HAIR (Hardness-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Introspective Reasoning), a novel alignment approach inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. Our approach consists of two main components: (1) construction of a balanced safety Chain-of-Draft (CoD) dataset for seven harmful categories using structured prompts that leverage the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs; and (2) training of category-specific reward models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning optimization to task difficulty at both the data and model levels. Comprehensive experiments across four harmlessness and four usefulness benchmarks demonstrate that HAIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all baseline methods in safety while maintaining high levels of usefulness.





## Small-Scale-Fading-Aware Resource Allocation in Wireless Federated Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03533v1
- **Authors**: ['Jiacheng Wang', 'Le Liang', 'Hao Ye', 'Chongtao Guo', 'Shi Jin']
- **Abstrat**: Judicious resource allocation can effectively enhance federated learning (FL) training performance in wireless networks by addressing both system and statistical heterogeneity. However, existing strategies typically rely on block fading assumptions, which overlooks rapid channel fluctuations within each round of FL gradient uploading, leading to a degradation in FL training performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a small-scale-fading-aware resource allocation strategy using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Specifically, we establish a one-step convergence bound of the FL algorithm and formulate the resource allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which is subsequently solved using the QMIX algorithm. In our framework, each client serves as an agent that dynamically determines spectrum and power allocations within each coherence time slot, based on local observations and a reward derived from the convergence analysis. The MARL setting reduces the dimensionality of the action space and facilitates decentralized decision-making, enhancing the scalability and practicality of the solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our QMIX-based resource allocation strategy significantly outperforms baseline methods across various degrees of statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, ablation studies validate the critical importance of incorporating small-scale fading dynamics, highlighting its role in optimizing FL performance.





## Pushing the boundary on Natural Language Inference
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18376v2
- **Authors**: ['Pablo Miralles-GonzÃ¡lez', 'Javier Huertas-Tato', 'Alejandro MartÃ­n', 'David Camacho']
- **Abstrat**: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a central task in natural language understanding with applications in fact-checking, question answering, and information retrieval. Despite its importance, current NLI systems heavily rely on supervised learning with datasets that often contain annotation artifacts and biases, limiting generalization and real-world applicability. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning-based approach using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning in NLI, eliminating the need for labeled rationales and enabling this type of training on more challenging datasets such as ANLI. We fine-tune 7B, 14B, and 32B language models using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA and QLoRA), demonstrating strong performance across standard and adversarial NLI benchmarks. Our 32B AWQ-quantized model surpasses state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11 adversarial sets$\unicode{x2013}$or on all of them considering our replication$\unicode{x2013}$within a 22GB memory footprint, showing that robust reasoning can be retained under aggressive quantization. This work provides a scalable and practical framework for building robust NLI systems without sacrificing inference quality.

## Frenet Corridor Planner: An Optimal Local Path Planning Framework for Autonomous Driving
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03695v1
- **Authors**: ['Faizan M. Tariq', 'Zheng-Hang Yeh', 'Avinash Singh', 'David Isele', 'Sangjae Bae']
- **Abstrat**: Motivated by the requirements for effectiveness and efficiency, path-speed decomposition-based trajectory planning methods have widely been adopted for autonomous driving applications. While a global route can be pre-computed offline, real-time generation of adaptive local paths remains crucial. Therefore, we present the Frenet Corridor Planner (FCP), an optimization-based local path planning strategy for autonomous driving that ensures smooth and safe navigation around obstacles. Modeling the vehicles as safety-augmented bounding boxes and pedestrians as convex hulls in the Frenet space, our approach defines a drivable corridor by determining the appropriate deviation side for static obstacles. Thereafter, a modified space-domain bicycle kinematics model enables path optimization for smoothness, boundary clearance, and dynamic obstacle risk minimization. The optimized path is then passed to a speed planner to generate the final trajectory. We validate FCP through extensive simulations and real-world hardware experiments, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.





## Rapid AI-based generation of coverage paths for dispensing applications

- **Authors**: ['Simon Baeuerle', 'Ian F. Mendonca', 'Kristof Van Laerhoven', 'Ralf Mikut', 'Andreas Steimer']
- **Abstrat**: Coverage Path Planning of Thermal Interface Materials (TIM) plays a crucial role in the design of power electronics and electronic control units. Up to now, this is done manually by experts or by using optimization approaches with a high computational effort. We propose a novel AI-based approach to generate dispense paths for TIM and similar dispensing applications. It is a drop-in replacement for optimization-based approaches. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) receives the target cooling area as input and directly outputs the dispense path. Our proposed setup does not require labels and we show its feasibility on multiple target areas. The resulting dispense paths can be directly transferred to automated manufacturing equipment and do not exhibit air entrapments. The approach of using an ANN to predict process parameters for a desired target state in real-time could potentially be transferred to other manufacturing processes.





## Model Predictive Fuzzy Control: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Control Architecture for Outdoor Search-and-Rescue Robots
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03257v1
- **Authors**: ['Craig Maxwell', 'Mirko Baglioni', 'Anahita Jamshidnejad']
- **Abstrat**: Autonomous robots deployed in unknown search-and-rescue (SaR) environments can significantly improve the efficiency of the mission by assisting in fast localisation and rescue of the trapped victims. We propose a novel integrated hierarchical control architecture, called model predictive fuzzy control (MPFC), for autonomous mission planning of multi-robot SaR systems that should efficiently map an unknown environment: We combine model predictive control (MPC) and fuzzy logic control (FLC), where the robots are locally controlled by computationally efficient FLC controllers, and the parameters of these local controllers are tuned via a centralised MPC controller, in a regular or event-triggered manner. The proposed architecture provides three main advantages: (1) The control decisions are made by the FLC controllers, thus the real-time computation time is affordable. (2) The centralised MPC controller optimises the performance criteria with a global and predictive vision of the system dynamics, and updates the parameters of the FLC controllers accordingly. (3) FLC controllers are heuristic by nature and thus do not take into account optimality in their decisions, while the tuned parameters via the MPC controller can indirectly incorporate some level of optimality in local decisions of the robots. A simulation environment for victim detection in a disaster environment was designed in MATLAB using discrete, 2-D grid-based models. While being comparable from the point of computational efficiency, the integrated MPFC architecture improves the performance of the multi-robot SaR system compared to decentralised FLC controllers. Moreover, the performance of MPFC is comparable to the performance of centralised MPC for path planning of SaR robots, whereas MPFC requires significantly less computational resources, since the number of the optimisation variables in the control problem are reduced.
