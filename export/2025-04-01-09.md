- **Abstrat**: Recent advancements in Chain of Thought (COT) generation have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as an effective post-training approach. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling, and RL robustness against noisy signals.

- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24296v1
- **Authors**: ['Yubo Zhang', 'Pedro Botelho', 'Trevor Gordon', 'Gil Zussman', 'Igor Kadota']
- **Abstrat**: We consider a decentralized wireless network with several source-destination pairs sharing a limited number of orthogonal frequency bands. Sources learn to adapt their transmissions (specifically, their band selection strategy) over time, in a decentralized manner, without sharing information with each other. Sources can only observe the outcome of their own transmissions (i.e., success or collision), having no prior knowledge of the network size or of the transmission strategy of other sources. The goal of each source is to maximize their own throughput while striving for network-wide fairness. We propose a novel fully decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based solution that achieves fairness without coordination. The proposed Fair Share RL (FSRL) solution combines: (i) state augmentation with a semi-adaptive time reference; (ii) an architecture that leverages risk control and time difference likelihood; and (iii) a fairness-driven reward structure. We evaluate FSRL in more than 50 network settings with different number of agents, different amounts of available spectrum, in the presence of jammers, and in an ad-hoc setting. Simulation results suggest that, when we compare FSRL with a common baseline RL algorithm from the literature, FSRL can be up to 89.0% fairer (as measured by Jain's fairness index) in stringent settings with several sources and a single frequency band, and 48.1% fairer on average.





## Rec-R1: Bridging Generative Large Language Models and User-Centric Recommendation Systems via Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24289v1
- **Authors**: ['Jiacheng Lin', 'Tian Wang', 'Kun Qian']
- **Abstrat**: We propose Rec-R1, a general reinforcement learning framework that bridges large language models (LLMs) with recommendation systems through closed-loop optimization. Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.





## Moving Edge for On-Demand Edge Computing: An Uncertainty-aware Approach
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24214v1
- **Authors**: ['Fangtong Zhou', 'Ruozhou Yu']
- **Abstrat**: We study an edge demand response problem where, based on historical edge workload demands, an edge provider needs to dispatch moving computing units, e.g. truck-carried modular data centers, in response to emerging hotspots within service area. The goal of edge provider is to maximize the expected revenue brought by serving congested users with satisfactory performance, while minimizing the costs of moving units and the potential service-level agreement violation penalty for interrupted services. The challenge is to make robust predictions for future demands, as well as optimized moving unit dispatching decisions. We propose a learning-based, uncertain-aware moving unit scheduling framework, URANUS, to address this problem. Our framework novelly combines Bayesian deep learning and distributionally robust approximation to make predictions that are robust to data, model and distributional uncertainties in deep learning-based prediction models. Based on the robust prediction outputs, we further propose an efficient planning algorithm to optimize moving unit scheduling in an online manner. Simulation experiments show that URANUS can significantly improve robustness in decision making, and achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning, uncertainty-agnostic learning-based methods, and other baselines.





## Ride-Sourcing Vehicle Rebalancing with Service Accessibility Guarantees via Constrained Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24183v1
- **Authors**: ['Matej Jusup', 'Kenan Zhang', 'Zhiyuan Hu', 'Barna PÃ¡sztor', 'Andreas Krause', 'Francesco Corman']
- **Abstrat**: The rapid expansion of ride-sourcing services such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi Chuxing has fundamentally reshaped urban transportation by offering flexible, on-demand mobility via mobile applications. Despite their convenience, these platforms confront significant operational challenges, particularly vehicle rebalancing - the strategic repositioning of thousands of vehicles to address spatiotemporal mismatches in supply and demand. Inadequate rebalancing results in prolonged rider waiting times, inefficient vehicle utilization, and inequitable distribution of services, leading to disparities in driver availability and income.   To tackle these complexities, we introduce scalable continuous-state mean-field control (MFC) and reinforcement learning (MFRL) models that explicitly represent each vehicle's precise location and employ continuous repositioning actions guided by the distribution of other vehicles. To ensure equitable service distribution, an accessibility constraint is integrated within our optimal control formulation, balancing operational efficiency with equitable access to the service across geographic regions. Our approach acknowledges realistic conditions, including inherent stochasticity in transitions, the simultaneous occurrence of vehicle-rider matching, vehicles' rebalancing and cruising, and variability in rider behaviors. Crucially, we relax the traditional mean-field assumption of equal supply-demand volume, better reflecting practical scenarios. Extensive empirical evaluation using real-world data-driven simulation of Shenzhen demonstrates the real-time efficiency and robustness of our approach at the scale of tens of thousands of vehicles.   The code is available at https://github.com/mjusup1501/mf-vehicle-rebalancing.





## Studying the Interplay Between the Actor and Critic Representations in Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06343v2
- **Authors**: ['Samuel Garcin', 'Trevor McInroe', 'Pablo Samuel Castro', 'Prakash Panangaden', 'Christopher G. Lucas', 'David Abel', 'Stefano V. Albrecht']
- **Abstrat**: Extracting relevant information from a stream of high-dimensional observations is a central challenge for deep reinforcement learning agents. Actor-critic algorithms add further complexity to this challenge, as it is often unclear whether the same information will be relevant to both the actor and the critic. To this end, we here explore the principles that underlie effective representations for the actor and for the critic in on-policy algorithms. We focus our study on understanding whether the actor and critic will benefit from separate, rather than shared, representations. Our primary finding is that when separated, the representations for the actor and critic systematically specialise in extracting different types of information from the environment -- the actor's representation tends to focus on action-relevant information, while the critic's representation specialises in encoding value and dynamics information. We conduct a rigourous empirical study to understand how different representation learning approaches affect the actor and critic's specialisations and their downstream performance, in terms of sample efficiency and generation capabilities. Finally, we discover that a separated critic plays an important role in exploration and data collection during training. Our code, trained models and data are accessible at https://github.com/francelico/deac-rep.





## Learning a Canonical Basis of Human Preferences from Binary Ratings
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24150v1
- **Authors**: ['Kailas Vodrahalli', 'Wei Wei', 'James Zou']
- **Abstrat**: Recent advances in generative AI have been driven by alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). RLHF and related techniques typically involve constructing a dataset of binary or ranked choice human preferences and subsequently fine-tuning models to align with these preferences. This paper shifts the focus to understanding the preferences encoded in such datasets and identifying common human preferences. We find that a small subset of 21 preference categories (selected from a set of nearly 5,000 distinct preferences) captures >89% of preference variation across individuals. This small set of preferences is analogous to a canonical basis of human preferences, similar to established findings that characterize human variation in psychology or facial recognition studies. Through both synthetic and empirical evaluations, we confirm that our low-rank, canonical set of human preferences generalizes across the entire dataset and within specific topics. We further demonstrate our preference basis' utility in model evaluation, where our preference categories offer deeper insights into model alignment, and in model training, where we show that fine-tuning on preference-defined subsets successfully aligns the model accordingly.





## Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomous Two Device Navigation of Cerebral Vessels in Mechanical Thrombectomy
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24140v1
- **Authors**: ['Harry Robertshaw', 'Benjamin Jackson', 'Jiaheng Wang', 'Hadi Sadati', 'Lennart Karstensen', 'Alejandro Granados', 'Thomas C Booth']
- **Abstrat**: Purpose: Autonomous systems in mechanical thrombectomy (MT) hold promise for reducing procedure times, minimizing radiation exposure, and enhancing patient safety. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) methods only reach the carotid arteries, are not generalizable to other patient vasculatures, and do not consider safety. We propose a safe dual-device RL algorithm that can navigate beyond the carotid arteries to cerebral vessels.   Methods: We used the Simulation Open Framework Architecture to represent the intricacies of cerebral vessels, and a modified Soft Actor-Critic RL algorithm to learn, for the first time, the navigation of micro-catheters and micro-guidewires. We incorporate patient safety metrics into our reward function by integrating guidewire tip forces. Inverse RL is used with demonstrator data on 12 patient-specific vascular cases.   Results: Our simulation demonstrates successful autonomous navigation within unseen cerebral vessels, achieving a 96% success rate, 7.0s procedure time, and 0.24 N mean forces, well below the proposed 1.5 N vessel rupture threshold.   Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, our proposed autonomous system for MT two-device navigation reaches cerebral vessels, considers safety, and is generalizable to unseen patient-specific cases for the first time. We envisage future work will extend the validation to vasculatures of different complexity and on in vitro models. While our contributions pave the way towards deploying agents in clinical settings, safety and trustworthiness will be crucial elements to consider when proposing new methodology.





## Level the Level: Balancing Game Levels for Asymmetric Player Archetypes With Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24099v1
- **Authors**: ['Florian Rupp', 'Kai Eckert']
- **Abstrat**: Balancing games, especially those with asymmetric multiplayer content, requires significant manual effort and extensive human playtesting during development. For this reason, this work focuses on generating balanced levels tailored to asymmetric player archetypes, where the disparity in abilities is balanced entirely through the level design. For instance, while one archetype may have an advantage over another, both should have an equal chance of winning. We therefore conceptualize game balancing as a procedural content generation problem and build on and extend a recently introduced method that uses reinforcement learning to balance tile-based game levels. We evaluate the method on four different player archetypes and demonstrate its ability to balance a larger proportion of levels compared to two baseline approaches. Furthermore, our results indicate that as the disparity between player archetypes increases, the required number of training steps grows, while the model's accuracy in achieving balance decreases.





## HACTS: a Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System for Robot Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24070v1
- **Authors**: ['Zhiyuan Xu', 'Yinuo Zhao', 'Kun Wu', 'Ning Liu', 'Junjie Ji', 'Zhengping Che', 'Chi Harold Liu', 'Jian Tang']
- **Abstrat**: Teleoperation is essential for autonomous robot learning, especially in manipulation tasks that require human demonstrations or corrections. However, most existing systems only offer unilateral robot control and lack the ability to synchronize the robot's status with the teleoperation hardware, preventing real-time, flexible intervention. In this work, we introduce HACTS (Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System), a novel system that establishes bilateral, real-time joint synchronization between a robot arm and teleoperation hardware. This simple yet effective feedback mechanism, akin to a steering wheel in autonomous vehicles, enables the human copilot to intervene seamlessly while collecting action-correction data for future learning. Implemented using 3D-printed components and low-cost, off-the-shelf motors, HACTS is both accessible and scalable. Our experiments show that HACTS significantly enhances performance in imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, boosting IL recovery capabilities and data efficiency, and facilitating human-in-the-loop RL. HACTS paves the way for more effective and interactive human-robot collaboration and data-collection, advancing the capabilities of robot manipulation.





## Impact of Amplitude and Phase Damping Noise on Quantum Reinforcement Learning: Challenges and Opportunities
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24069v1
- **Authors**: ['MarÃ­a Laura Olivera-Atencio', 'Lucas Lamata', 'JesÃºs Casado-Pascual']
- **Abstrat**: Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field with significant potential, yet it remains highly susceptible to noise, which poses a major challenge to its practical implementation. While various noise mitigation strategies have been proposed to enhance algorithmic performance, the impact of noise is not fully understood. In this work, we investigate the effects of amplitude and phase damping noise on a quantum reinforcement learning algorithm. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we assess how these noise sources influence the learning process and overall performance. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of noise in quantum learning algorithms and suggest that, rather than being purely detrimental, unavoidable noise may present opportunities to enhance QML processes.





## Exploring Data Scaling Trends and Effects in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22230v2
- **Authors**: ['Wei Shen', 'Guanlin Liu', 'Zheng Wu', 'Ruofei Zhu', 'Qingping Yang', 'Chao Xin', 'Yu Yue', 'Lin Yan']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning large language models with human preferences. While recent research has focused on algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has been overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven bottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and decreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to mitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method, Pre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness. Additionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in RLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model sizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that RTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth, and then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid capture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial improvements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance of careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome performance barriers in RLHF.





## Multi-User MISO with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces: A DRL-Based Sum-Rate Optimization Approach
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04837v2
- **Authors**: ['Hao Liu', 'Jiancheng An', 'George C. Alexandropoulos', 'Derrick Wing Kwan Ng', 'Chau Yuen', 'Lu Gan']
- **Abstrat**: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) represent a novel signal processing paradigm that enables over-the-air processing of electromagnetic waves at the speed of light. Their multi-layer architecture exhibits customizable computational capabilities compared to conventional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and metasurface lenses. In this paper, we deploy SIM to improve the performance of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems through a low complexity manner with reduced numbers of transmit radio frequency chains. In particular, an optimization formulation for the joint design of the SIM phase shifts and the transmit power allocation is presented, which is efficiently tackled via a customized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that systematically explores pre-designed states of the SIM-parametrized smart wireless environment. The presented performance evaluation results demonstrate the proposed method's capability to effectively learn from the wireless environment, while consistently outperforming conventional precoding schemes under low transmit power conditions. Furthermore, the implementation of hyperparameter tuning and whitening process significantly enhance the robustness of the proposed DRL framework.





## A Reactive Framework for Whole-Body Motion Planning of Mobile Manipulators Combining Reinforcement Learning and SDF-Constrained Quadratic Programmi
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23975v1
- **Authors**: ['Chenyu Zhang', 'Shiying Sun', 'Kuan Liu', 'Chuanbao Zhou', 'Xiaoguang Zhao', 'Min Tan', 'Yanlong Huang']
- **Abstrat**: As an important branch of embodied artificial intelligence, mobile manipulators are increasingly applied in intelligent services, but their redundant degrees of freedom also limit efficient motion planning in cluttered environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid learning and optimization framework for reactive whole-body motion planning of mobile manipulators. We develop the Bayesian distributional soft actor-critic (Bayes-DSAC) algorithm to improve the quality of value estimation and the convergence performance of the learning. Additionally, we introduce a quadratic programming method constrained by the signed distance field to enhance the safety of the obstacle avoidance motion. We conduct experiments and make comparison with standard benchmark. The experimental results verify that our proposed framework significantly improves the efficiency of reactive whole-body motion planning, reduces the planning time, and improves the success rate of motion planning. Additionally, the proposed reinforcement learning method ensures a rapid learning process in the whole-body planning task. The novel framework allows mobile manipulators to adapt to complex environments more safely and efficiently.





## Noise-based reward-modulated learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23972v1
- **Authors**: ['JesÃºs GarcÃ­a FernÃ¡ndez', 'Nasir Ahmad', 'Marcel van Gerven']
- **Abstrat**: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to significant improvements in task performance. However, training neural networks in an RL regime is typically achieved in combination with backpropagation, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments or when using non-differentiable neural networks. While noise-based alternatives like reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL) have been proposed, their performance has remained limited, especially in scenarios with delayed rewards, which require retrospective credit assignment over time. Here, we derive a novel noise-based learning rule that addresses these challenges. Our approach combines directional derivative theory with Hebbian-like updates to enable efficient, gradient-free learning in RL. It features stochastic noisy neurons which can approximate gradients, and produces local synaptic updates modulated by a global reward signal. Drawing on concepts from neuroscience, our method uses reward prediction error as its optimization target to generate increasingly advantageous behavior, and incorporates an eligibility trace to facilitate temporal credit assignment in environments with delayed rewards. Its formulation relies on local information alone, making it compatible with implementations in neuromorphic hardware. Experimental validation shows that our approach significantly outperforms RMHL and is competitive with BP-based baselines, highlighting the promise of noise-based, biologically inspired learning for low-power and real-time applications.





## Entropy-guided sequence weighting for efficient exploration in RL-based LLM fine-tuning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22456v2
- **Authors**: ['Abdullah Vanlioglu']
- **Abstrat**: We introduce Entropy-Guided Sequence Weighting (EGSW), a novel approach that enhances the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by dynamically assigning weights to generated outputs based on their advantage and entropy for Reinforcement Learning-based Large Language Model fine-tuning. EGSW integrates entropy regularization with advantage-based weighting to balance policy updates, enabling efficient exploration in high-dimensional state spaces. By employing temperature-scaled softmax weighting over sequences, EGSW prioritizing high-reward, high-uncertainty steps while maintaining training stability. Although originally developed to improve Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, EGSW is generalizable to other reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and can be implemented in both step-wise and trajectory-wise settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that EGSW enhances GRPO reasoning ability, yielding improvements in sample efficiency. Future work will explore the application of EGSW to advanced RL methodologies.





## MAER-Nav: Bidirectional Motion Learning Through Mirror-Augmented Experience Replay for Robot Navigation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23908v1
- **Authors**: ['Shanze Wang', 'Mingao Tan', 'Zhibo Yang', 'Biao Huang', 'Xiaoyu Shen', 'Hailong Huang', 'Wei Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based navigation methods have demonstrated promising results for mobile robots, but suffer from limited action flexibility in confined spaces. Conventional DRL approaches predominantly learn forward-motion policies, causing robots to become trapped in complex environments where backward maneuvers are necessary for recovery. This paper presents MAER-Nav (Mirror-Augmented Experience Replay for Robot Navigation), a novel framework that enables bidirectional motion learning without requiring explicit failure-driven hindsight experience replay or reward function modifications. Our approach integrates a mirror-augmented experience replay mechanism with curriculum learning to generate synthetic backward navigation experiences from successful trajectories. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that MAER-Nav significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strong forward navigation capabilities. The framework effectively bridges the gap between the comprehensive action space utilization of traditional planning methods and the environmental adaptability of learning-based approaches, enabling robust navigation in scenarios where conventional DRL methods consistently fail.





## Expanding RL with Verifiable Rewards Across Diverse Domains
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23829v1
- **Authors**: ['Yi Su', 'Dian Yu', 'Linfeng Song', 'Juntao Li', 'Haitao Mi', 'Zhaopeng Tu', 'Min Zhang', 'Dong Yu']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promising results in mathematical reasoning and coding tasks where well-structured reference answers are available. However, its applicability to broader domains remains underexplored. In this work, we study the extension of RLVR to more diverse domains such as medicine, chemistry, psychology, and economics. We observe high agreement in binary judgments across different large language models (LLMs) when objective reference answers exist, which challenges the necessity of large-scale annotation for training domain-specific reward models. To address the limitations of binary rewards when handling unstructured reference answers, we further incorporate model-based soft scoring into RLVR to improve its flexibility. Our experiments show that a distilled generative reward model can serve as an effective cross-domain verifier, providing reliable reward signals for RL without requiring domain-specific annotations. By fine-tuning a base 7B model using various RL algorithms against our reward model, we obtain policies that outperform state-of-the-art open-source aligned LLMs such as Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by a large margin, across domains in free-form answer settings. This also strengthens RLVR's robustness and scalability, highlighting its potential for real-world applications with noisy or weak labels.

## Value of Information-based Deceptive Path Planning Under Adversarial Interventions
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24284v1
- **Authors**: ['Wesley A. Suttle', 'Jesse Milzman', 'Mustafa O. Karabag', 'Brian M. Sadler', 'Ufuk Topcu']
- **Abstrat**: Existing methods for deceptive path planning (DPP) address the problem of designing paths that conceal their true goal from a passive, external observer. Such methods do not apply to problems where the observer has the ability to perform adversarial interventions to impede the path planning agent. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov decision process (MDP)-based model for the DPP problem under adversarial interventions and develop new value of information (VoI) objectives to guide the design of DPP policies. Using the VoI objectives we propose, path planning agents deceive the adversarial observer into choosing suboptimal interventions by selecting trajectories that are of low informational value to the observer. Leveraging connections to the linear programming theory for MDPs, we derive computationally efficient solution methods for synthesizing policies for performing DPP under adversarial interventions. In our experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution method in achieving deceptiveness under adversarial interventions and demonstrate the superior performance of our approach to both existing DPP methods and conservative path planning approaches on illustrative gridworld problems.





## Bi-Level Route Optimization and Path Planning with Hazard Exploration
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24044v1
- **Authors**: ['Jimin Choi', 'Grant Stagg', 'Cameron K. Peterson', 'Max Z. Li']
- **Abstrat**: Effective risk monitoring in dynamic environments such as disaster zones requires an adaptive exploration strategy to detect hidden threats. We propose a bi-level unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring strategy that efficiently integrates high-level route optimization with low-level path planning for known and unknown hazards. At the high level, we formulate the route optimization as a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to determine the optimal sequence for visiting known hazard locations. To strategically incorporate exploration efficiency, we introduce an edge-based centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), which refines baseline routes using pseudo-nodes and allocates path budgets based on the UAV's battery capacity using a line segment Voronoi diagram. At the low level, path planning maximizes information gain within the allocated path budget by generating kinematically feasible B-spline trajectories. Bayesian inference is applied to dynamically update hazard probabilities, enabling the UAVs to prioritize unexplored regions. Simulation results demonstrate that edge-based CVT improves spatial coverage and route uniformity compared to the node-based method. Additionally, our optimized path planning consistently outperforms baselines in hazard discovery rates across a diverse set of scenarios.





## On the order of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problems
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20550v2
- **Authors**: ['Tomoki Nakamigawa', 'Tadashi Sakuma']
- **Abstrat**: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. Let $k$ be the number of vertices of such a longest path of $T$ that every vertex of the path is a cut vertex and that every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $T$. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $n+k < N$. A configuration of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A move is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequence of the pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is in $O(Nn + n^2 \log(\min\{n,k\}))$ if $G$ is a $N$-vertex tree, and it is in $O(N^2 + \frac{n^3}{N-n} + n^2 \log(\min\{n,N-n\}))$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. We provide an algorithm that can obtain a solution sequence of lengths that satisfy these orders, with the same computational complexity as the order of the length.
