- **Abstrat**: Robust grasping of various objects from single-view perception is fundamental for dexterous robots. Previous works often rely on fully observable objects, expert demonstrations, or static grasping poses, which restrict their generalization ability and adaptability to external disturbances. In this paper, we present a reinforcement-learning-based framework that enables zero-shot dynamic dexterous grasping of a wide range of unseen objects from single-view perception, while performing adaptive motions to external disturbances. We utilize a hand-centric object representation for shape feature extraction that emphasizes interaction-relevant local shapes, enhancing robustness to shape variance and uncertainty. To enable effective hand adaptation to disturbances with limited observations, we propose a mixed curriculum learning strategy, which first utilizes imitation learning to distill a policy trained with privileged real-time visual-tactile feedback, and gradually transfers to reinforcement learning to learn adaptive motions under disturbances caused by observation noises and dynamic randomization. Our experiments demonstrate strong generalization in grasping unseen objects with random poses, achieving success rates of 97.0% across 247,786 simulated objects and 94.6% across 512 real objects. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method to various disturbances, including unobserved object movement and external forces, through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

## Concise Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05185v1
- **Authors**: ['Mehdi Fatemi', 'Banafsheh Rafiee', 'Mingjie Tang', 'Kartik Talamadupula']
- **Abstrat**: Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), a major drawback of reasoning models is their enormous token usage, which increases computational cost, resource requirements, and response time. In this work, we revisit the core principles of reinforcement learning (RL) and, through mathematical analysis, demonstrate that the tendency to generate lengthy responses arises inherently from RL-based optimization during training. This finding questions the prevailing assumption that longer responses inherently improve reasoning accuracy. Instead, we uncover a natural correlation between conciseness and accuracy that has been largely overlooked. Moreover, we show that introducing a secondary phase of RL post-training, using a small set of problems and limited resources, can significantly reduce a model's chain of thought while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. Finally, we validate our conclusions through extensive experimental results.





## Lightweight and Direct Document Relevance Optimization for Generative Information Retrieval
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05181v1
- **Authors**: ['Kidist Amde Mekonnen', 'Yubao Tang', 'Maarten de Rijke']
- **Abstrat**: Generative information retrieval (GenIR) is a promising neural retrieval paradigm that formulates document retrieval as a document identifier (docid) generation task, allowing for end-to-end optimization toward a unified global retrieval objective. However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions. These findings highlight DDRO's potential to enhance retrieval effectiveness with a simplified optimization approach. By framing alignment as a direct optimization problem, DDRO simplifies the ranking optimization pipeline of GenIR models while offering a viable alternative to reinforcement learning-based methods.





## RLBayes: a Bayesian Network Structure Learning Algorithm via Reinforcement Learning-Based Search Strategy
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05167v1
- **Authors**: ['Mingcan Wang', 'Junchang Xin', 'Luxuan Qu', 'Qi Chen', 'Zhiqiong Wang']
- **Abstrat**: The score-based structure learning of Bayesian network (BN) is an effective way to learn BN models, which are regarded as some of the most compelling probabilistic graphical models in the field of representation and reasoning under uncertainty. However, the search space of structure learning grows super-exponentially as the number of variables increases, which makes BN structure learning an NP-hard problem, as well as a combination optimization problem (COP). Despite the successes of many heuristic methods on it, the results of the structure learning of BN are usually unsatisfactory. Inspired by Q-learning, in this paper, a Bayesian network structure learning algorithm via reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) search strategy is proposed, namely RLBayes. The method borrows the idea of RL and tends to record and guide the learning process by a dynamically maintained Q-table. By creating and maintaining the dynamic Q-table, RLBayes achieve storing the unlimited search space within limited space, thereby achieving the structure learning of BN via Q-learning. Not only is it theoretically proved that RLBayes can converge to the global optimal BN structure, but also it is experimentally proved that RLBayes has a better effect than almost all other heuristic search algorithms.





## A Reinforcement Learning Method for Environments with Stochastic Variables: Post-Decision Proximal Policy Optimization with Dual Critic Networks
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05150v1
- **Authors**: ['Leonardo Kanashiro Felizardo', 'Edoardo Fadda', 'Paolo Brandimarte', 'Emilio Del-Moral-Hernandez', 'Mariá Cristina Vasconcelos Nascimento']
- **Abstrat**: This paper presents Post-Decision Proximal Policy Optimization (PDPPO), a novel variation of the leading deep reinforcement learning method, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The PDPPO state transition process is divided into two steps: a deterministic step resulting in the post-decision state and a stochastic step leading to the next state. Our approach incorporates post-decision states and dual critics to reduce the problem's dimensionality and enhance the accuracy of value function estimation. Lot-sizing is a mixed integer programming problem for which we exemplify such dynamics. The objective of lot-sizing is to optimize production, delivery fulfillment, and inventory levels in uncertain demand and cost parameters. This paper evaluates the performance of PDPPO across various environments and configurations. Notably, PDPPO with a dual critic architecture achieves nearly double the maximum reward of vanilla PPO in specific scenarios, requiring fewer episode iterations and demonstrating faster and more consistent learning across different initializations. On average, PDPPO outperforms PPO in environments with a stochastic component in the state transition. These results support the benefits of using a post-decision state. Integrating this post-decision state in the value function approximation leads to more informed and efficient learning in high-dimensional and stochastic environments.

- **Abstrat**: We present VAPO, Value-based Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization framework for reasoning models., a novel framework tailored for reasoning models within the value-based paradigm. Benchmarked the AIME 2024 dataset, VAPO, built on the Qwen 32B pre-trained model, attains a state-of-the-art score of $\mathbf{60.4}$. In direct comparison under identical experimental settings, VAPO outperforms the previously reported results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B and DAPO by more than 10 points. The training process of VAPO stands out for its stability and efficiency. It reaches state-of-the-art performance within a mere 5,000 steps. Moreover, across multiple independent runs, no training crashes occur, underscoring its reliability. This research delves into long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning using a value-based reinforcement learning framework. We pinpoint three key challenges that plague value-based methods: value model bias, the presence of heterogeneous sequence lengths, and the sparsity of reward signals. Through systematic design, VAPO offers an integrated solution that effectively alleviates these challenges, enabling enhanced performance in long-CoT reasoning tasks.





## Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108v1
- **Authors**: ['Anja Surina', 'Amin Mansouri', 'Lars Quaedvlieg', 'Amal Seddas', 'Maryna Viazovska', 'Emmanuel Abbe', 'Caglar Gulcehre']
- **Abstrat**: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM -through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.





## Can RLHF be More Efficient with Imperfect Reward Models? A Policy Coverage Perspective
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v2
- **Authors**: ['Jiawei Huang', 'Bingcong Li', 'Christoph Dann', 'Niao He']
- **Abstrat**: Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's coverability of the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose novel transfer learning principles and a theoretical algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Empirically, inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a win-rate-based transfer policy selection method with improved computational efficiency. Moreover, our empirical transfer learning technique is modular and can be integrated with various policy optimization methods, such as DPO, IPO and XPO, to further enhance their performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on summarization tasks.





## Attention-Augmented Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Graph Convolutions for Multi-Agent Task Allocation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05045v1
- **Authors**: ['Huilin Yin', 'Zhikun Yang', 'Daniel Watzenig']
- **Abstrat**: Multi-agent task allocation (MATA) plays a vital role in cooperative multi-agent systems, with significant implications for applications such as logistics, search and rescue, and robotic coordination. Although traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising, their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward functions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.





## Joint Pedestrian and Vehicle Traffic Optimization in Urban Environments using Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05018v1
- **Authors**: ['Bibek Poudel', 'Xuan Wang', 'Weizi Li', 'Lei Zhu', 'Kevin Heaslip']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for adaptive traffic signal control. While existing RL-based methods demonstrate effectiveness in reducing vehicular congestion, their predominant focus on vehicle-centric optimization leaves pedestrian mobility needs and safety challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we present a deep RL framework for adaptive control of eight traffic signals along a real-world urban corridor, jointly optimizing both pedestrian and vehicular efficiency. Our single-agent policy is trained using real-world pedestrian and vehicle demand data derived from Wi-Fi logs and video analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-time signals, reducing average wait times per pedestrian and per vehicle by up to 67% and 52%, respectively, while simultaneously decreasing total accumulated wait times for both groups by up to 67% and 53%. Additionally, our results demonstrate generalization capabilities across varying traffic demands, including conditions entirely unseen during training, validating RL's potential for developing transportation systems that serve all road users.





## Ensuring Safety in an Uncertain Environment: Constrained MDPs via Stochastic Thresholds
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04973v1
- **Authors**: ['Qian Zuo', 'Fengxiang He']
- **Abstrat**: This paper studies constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with constraints against stochastic thresholds, aiming at safety of reinforcement learning in unknown and uncertain environments. We leverage a Growing-Window estimator sampling from interactions with the uncertain and dynamic environment to estimate the thresholds, based on which we design Stochastic Pessimistic-Optimistic Thresholding (SPOT), a novel model-based primal-dual algorithm for multiple constraints against stochastic thresholds. SPOT enables reinforcement learning under both pessimistic and optimistic threshold settings. We prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret and constraint violation; i.e., a reward regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ while allowing an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation over $T$ episodes. The theoretical guarantees show that our algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of an approach relying on fixed and clear thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, SPOT is the first reinforcement learning algorithm that realises theoretical guaranteed performance in an uncertain environment where even thresholds are unknown.





## A Unified Pairwise Framework for RLHF: Bridging Generative Reward Modeling and Policy Optimization
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04950v1
- **Authors**: ['Wenyuan Xu', 'Xiaochen Zuo', 'Chao Xin', 'Yu Yue', 'Lin Yan', 'Yonghui Wu']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.





## Probabilistic Pontryagin's Maximum Principle for Continuous-Time Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02543v2
- **Authors**: ['David Leeftink', 'Çağatay Yıldız', 'Steffen Ridderbusch', 'Max Hinne', 'Marcel van Gerven']
- **Abstrat**: Without exact knowledge of the true system dynamics, optimal control of non-linear continuous-time systems requires careful treatment of epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we propose a probabilistic extension to Pontryagin's maximum principle by minimizing the mean Hamiltonian with respect to epistemic uncertainty. We show minimization of the mean Hamiltonian is a necessary optimality condition when optimizing the mean cost, and propose a multiple shooting numerical method scalable to large-scale probabilistic dynamical models, including ensemble neural ordinary differential equations. Comparisons against state-of-the-art methods in online and offline model-based reinforcement learning tasks show that our probabilistic Hamiltonian formulation leads to reduced trial costs in offline settings and achieves competitive performance in online scenarios. By bridging optimal control and reinforcement learning, our approach offers a principled and practical framework for controlling uncertain systems with learned dynamics.





## Learning to Adapt through Bio-Inspired Gait Strategies for Versatile Quadruped Locomotion
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09440v2
- **Authors**: ['Joseph Humphreys', 'Chengxu Zhou']
- **Abstrat**: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionised quadruped robot locomotion, but existing control frameworks struggle to generalise beyond their training-induced observational scope, resulting in limited adaptability and gait proficiency. In contrast, animals achieve exceptional adaptability through gait transition strategies, diverse gait utilisation, and seamless adjustment to immediate environmental demands. Inspired by these capabilities, we present a novel DRL framework that incorporates key attributes of animal locomotion: gait transition strategies, pseudo gait procedural memory, and adaptive motion adjustments. This approach enables our framework to achieve unparalleled adaptability, demonstrated through blind zero-shot deployment on complex terrains and recovery from critically unstable states. Our findings offer valuable insights into the biomechanics of animal locomotion, paving the way for robust, adaptable robotic systems.





## Age-of-information minimization under energy harvesting and non-stationary environment
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04916v1
- **Authors**: ['Akanksha Jaiswal', 'Arpan Chattopadhyay']
- **Abstrat**: This work focuses on minimizing the age of information for multiple energy harvesting sources that sample data and transmit it to a sink node. At each time, the central scheduler selects one of the sources to probe the quality of its channel to the sink node, and then the assessed channel quality is utilized to determine whether a source will sample and send the packet. For a single source case, we assume that the probed channel quality is known at each time instant, model the problem of AoI minimization as a Markov decision process, and prove the optimal sampling policy threshold structure. We then use this threshold structure and propose an AEC-SW-UCRL2 algorithm to handle unknown and time varying energy harvesting rate and channel statistics, motivated by the popular SWUCRL2 algorithm for non stationary reinforcement learning. This algorithm is applicable when an upper bound is available for the total variation of each of these quantities over a time horizon. Furthermore, in situations where these variation budgets are not accessible, we introduce the AEC-BORL algorithm, motivated by the well known BORL algorithm. For the multiple source case, we demonstrate that the AoI minimization problem can be formulated as a constrained MDP, which can be relaxed using a Lagrange multiplier and decoupled into sub problems across source nodes. We also derive Whittle index based source scheduling policy for probing and an optimal threshold policy for source sampling. We next leverage this Whittle index and threshold structure to develop the WIT-SW-UCRL2 algorithm for unknown time varying energy harvesting rates and channel statistics under their respective variation budgets. Moreover, we also proposed a Whittle index and threshold based bandit over reinforcement learning (WIT-BORL) algorithm for unknown variation budgets. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms.





## DeepResearcher: Scaling Deep Research via Reinforcement Learning in Real-world Environments
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03160v2
- **Authors**: ['Yuxiang Zheng', 'Dayuan Fu', 'Xiangkun Hu', 'Xiaojie Cai', 'Lyumanshan Ye', 'Pengrui Lu', 'Pengfei Liu']
- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with web search capabilities have demonstrated impressive potential for deep research tasks. However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications. We release DeepResearcher at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DeepResearcher.





## Improving turbulence control through explainable deep learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02354v2
- **Authors**: ['Miguel Beneitez', 'Andres Cremades', 'Luca Guastoni', 'Ricardo Vinuesa']
- **Abstrat**: Turbulent-flow control aims to develop strategies that effectively manipulate fluid systems, such as the reduction of drag in transportation and enhancing energy efficiency, both critical steps towards reducing global CO$_2$ emissions. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers novel tools to discover flow-control strategies, which we combine with our knowledge of the physics of turbulence. We integrate explainable deep learning (XDL) to objectively identify the coherent structures containing the most informative regions in the flow, with a DRL model trained to reduce them. The trained model targets the most relevant regions in the flow to sustain turbulence and produces a drag reduction which is higher than that of a model specifically trained to reduce the drag, while using only half its power consumption. Moreover, the XDL model results in a better drag reduction than other models focusing on specific classically identified coherent structures. This demonstrates that combining DRL with XDL can produce causal control strategies that precisely target the most influential features of turbulence. By directly addressing the core mechanisms that sustain turbulence, our approach offers a powerful pathway towards its efficient control, which is a long-standing challenge in physics with profound implications for energy systems, climate modeling and aerodynamics.

## Towards Map-Agnostic Policies for Adaptive Informative Path Planning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17166v2
- **Authors**: ['Julius Rückin', 'David Morilla-Cabello', 'Cyrill Stachniss', 'Eduardo Montijano', 'Marija Popović']
- **Abstrat**: Robots are frequently tasked to gather relevant sensor data in unknown terrains. A key challenge for classical path planning algorithms used for autonomous information gathering is adaptively replanning paths online as the terrain is explored given limited onboard compute resources. Recently, learning-based approaches emerged that train planning policies offline and enable computationally efficient online replanning performing policy inference. These approaches are designed and trained for terrain monitoring missions assuming a single specific map representation, which limits their applicability to different terrains. To address these issues, we propose a novel formulation of the adaptive informative path planning problem unified across different map representations, enabling training and deploying planning policies in a larger variety of monitoring missions. Experimental results validate that our novel formulation easily integrates with classical non-learning-based planning approaches while maintaining their performance. Our trained planning policy performs similarly to state-of-the-art map-specifically trained policies. We validate our learned policy on unseen real-world terrain datasets.
