- **Abstrat**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced perception across text, vision, and audio, yet they often struggle with structured cross-modal reasoning, particularly when integrating audio and visual signals. We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice question answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we curate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with multiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves 85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which scores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy, EchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial interpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs. These results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning enhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to unify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning via reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate further research.

- **Abstrat**: Effective information searching is essential for enhancing the reasoning and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent research has explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities by interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these approaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1) Uncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search engines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the training process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module capable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query. During RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that incrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively eliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly challenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B LLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves comparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module even surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and instruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms.





## Active Sampling for MRI-based Sequential Decision Making
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04586v1
- **Authors**: ['Yuning Du', 'Jingshuai Liu', 'Rohan Dharmakumar', 'Sotirios A. Tsaftaris']
- **Abstrat**: Despite the superior diagnostic capability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), its use as a Point-of-Care (PoC) device remains limited by high cost and complexity. To enable such a future by reducing the magnetic field strength, one key approach will be to improve sampling strategies. Previous work has shown that it is possible to make diagnostic decisions directly from k-space with fewer samples. Such work shows that single diagnostic decisions can be made, but if we aspire to see MRI as a true PoC, multiple and sequential decisions are necessary while minimizing the number of samples acquired. We present a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework enabling comprehensive, sequential, diagnostic evaluation from undersampled k-space data. Our approach during inference actively adapts to sequential decisions to optimally sample. To achieve this, we introduce a training methodology that identifies the samples that contribute the best to each diagnostic objective using a step-wise weighting reward function. We evaluate our approach in two sequential knee pathology assessment tasks: ACL sprain detection and cartilage thickness loss assessment. Our framework achieves diagnostic performance competitive with various policy-based benchmarks on disease detection, severity quantification, and overall sequential diagnosis, while substantially saving k-space samples. Our approach paves the way for the future of MRI as a comprehensive and affordable PoC device. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/vios-s/MRI_Sequential_Active_Sampling





## Implicitly Aligning Humans and Autonomous Agents through Shared Task Abstractions
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04579v1
- **Authors**: ['Stéphane Aroca-Ouellette', 'Miguel Aroca-Ouellette', 'Katharina von der Wense', 'Alessandro Roncone']
- **Abstrat**: In collaborative tasks, autonomous agents fall short of humans in their capability to quickly adapt to new and unfamiliar teammates. We posit that a limiting factor for zero-shot coordination is the lack of shared task abstractions, a mechanism humans rely on to implicitly align with teammates. To address this gap, we introduce HA$^2$: Hierarchical Ad Hoc Agents, a framework leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to mimic the structured approach humans use in collaboration. We evaluate HA$^2$ in the Overcooked environment, demonstrating statistically significant improvement over existing baselines when paired with both unseen agents and humans, providing better resilience to environmental shifts, and outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.





## Fight Fire with Fire: Defending Against Malicious RL Fine-Tuning via Reward Neutralization
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04578v1
- **Authors**: ['Wenjun Cao']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning transforms large language models while creating a vulnerability we experimentally verify: Our experiment shows that malicious RL fine-tuning dismantles safety guardrails with remarkable efficiency, requiring only 50 steps and minimal adversarial prompts, with harmful escalating from 0-2 to 7-9. This attack vector particularly threatens open-source models with parameter-level access. Existing defenses targeting supervised fine-tuning prove ineffective against RL's dynamic feedback mechanisms. We introduce Reward Neutralization, the first defense framework specifically designed against RL fine-tuning attacks, establishing concise rejection patterns that render malicious reward signals ineffective. Our approach trains models to produce minimal-information rejections that attackers cannot exploit, systematically neutralizing attempts to optimize toward harmful outputs. Experiments validate that our approach maintains low harmful scores (no greater than 2) after 200 attack steps, while standard models rapidly deteriorate. This work provides the first constructive proof that robust defense against increasingly accessible RL attacks is achievable, addressing a critical security gap for open-weight models.





## Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning Based on Convex Scoring Functions
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04553v1
- **Authors**: ['Shanyu Han', 'Yang Liu', 'Xiang Yu']
- **Abstrat**: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework under a broad class of risk objectives, characterized by convex scoring functions. This class covers many common risk measures, such as variance, Expected Shortfall, entropic Value-at-Risk, and mean-risk utility. To resolve the time-inconsistency issue, we consider an augmented state space and an auxiliary variable and recast the problem as a two-state optimization problem. We propose a customized Actor-Critic algorithm and establish some theoretical approximation guarantees. A key theoretical contribution is that our results do not require the Markov decision process to be continuous. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary variable sampling method inspired by the alternating minimization algorithm, which is convergent under certain conditions. We validate our approach in simulation experiments with a financial application in statistical arbitrage trading, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm.





## A Two-Timescale Primal-Dual Framework for Reinforcement Learning via Online Dual Variable Guidance
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04494v1
- **Authors**: ['Axel Friedrich Wolter', 'Tobias Sutter']
- **Abstrat**: We study reinforcement learning by combining recent advances in regularized linear programming formulations with the classical theory of stochastic approximation. Motivated by the challenge of designing algorithms that leverage off-policy data while maintaining on-policy exploration, we propose PGDA-RL, a novel primal-dual Projected Gradient Descent-Ascent algorithm for solving regularized Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). PGDA-RL integrates experience replay-based gradient estimation with a two-timescale decomposition of the underlying nested optimization problem. The algorithm operates asynchronously, interacts with the environment through a single trajectory of correlated data, and updates its policy online in response to the dual variable associated with the occupation measure of the underlying MDP. We prove that PGDA-RL converges almost surely to the optimal value function and policy of the regularized MDP. Our convergence analysis relies on tools from stochastic approximation theory and holds under weaker assumptions than those required by existing primal-dual RL approaches, notably removing the need for a simulator or a fixed behavioral policy.





## Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Light Control in Intelligent Transportation Systems
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03669v4
- **Authors**: ['Ming Zhu', 'Xiao-Yang Liu', 'Sem Borst', 'Anwar Walid']
- **Abstrat**: Smart traffic lights in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are envisioned to greatly increase traffic efficiency and reduce congestion. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to adaptively control traffic lights based on the real-time traffic situation in a road network. However, conventional methods may suffer from poor scalability. In this paper, we investigate deep reinforcement learning to control traffic lights, and both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the intelligent behavior ``greenwave" (i.e., a vehicle will see a progressive cascade of green lights, and not have to brake at any intersection) emerges naturally a grid road network, which is proved to be the optimal policy in an avenue with multiple cross streets. As a first step, we use two DRL algorithms for the traffic light control problems in two scenarios. In a single road intersection, we verify that the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm delivers a thresholding policy; and in a grid road network, we adopt the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Secondly, numerical experiments show that the DQN algorithm delivers the optimal control, and the DDPG algorithm with passive observations has the capability to produce on its own a high-level intelligent behavior in a grid road network, namely, the ``greenwave" policy emerges. We also verify the ``greenwave" patterns in a $5 \times 10$ grid road network. Thirdly, the ``greenwave" patterns demonstrate that DRL algorithms produce favorable solutions since the ``greenwave" policy shown in experiment results is proved to be optimal in a specified traffic model (an avenue with multiple cross streets). The delivered policies both in a single road intersection and a grid road network demonstrate the scalability of DRL algorithms.





## RLMiniStyler: Light-weight RL Style Agent for Arbitrary Sequential Neural Style Generation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04424v1
- **Authors**: ['Jing Hu', 'Chengming Feng', 'Shu Hu', 'Ming-Ching Chang', 'Xin Li', 'Xi Wu', 'Xin Wang']
- **Abstrat**: Arbitrary style transfer aims to apply the style of any given artistic image to another content image. Still, existing deep learning-based methods often require significant computational costs to generate diverse stylized results. Motivated by this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for arbitrary style transfer RLMiniStyler. This framework leverages a unified reinforcement learning policy to iteratively guide the style transfer process by exploring and exploiting stylization feedback, generating smooth sequences of stylized results while achieving model lightweight. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-aware multi-task learning strategy that automatically adjusts loss weights to adapt to the content and style balance requirements at different training stages, thereby accelerating model convergence. Through a series of experiments across image various resolutions, we have validated the advantages of RLMiniStyler over other state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality, diverse artistic image sequences at a lower cost. Codes are available at https://github.com/fengxiaoming520/RLMiniStyler.





## A Heuristic-Integrated DRL Approach for Phase Optimization in Large-Scale RISs
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04401v1
- **Authors**: ['Wei Wang', 'Peizheng Li', 'Angela Doufexi', 'Mark A. Beach']
- **Abstrat**: Optimizing discrete phase shifts in large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is challenging due to their non-convex and non-linear nature. In this letter, we propose a heuristic-integrated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that (1) leverages accumulated actions over multiple steps in the double deep Q-network (DDQN) for RIS column-wise control and (2) integrates a greedy algorithm (GA) into each DRL step to refine the state via fine-grained, element-wise optimization of RIS configurations. By learning from GA-included states, the proposed approach effectively addresses RIS optimization within a small DRL action space, demonstrating its capability to optimize phase-shift configurations of large-scale RISs.





## Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335v2
- **Authors**: ['Andrew Zhao', 'Yiran Wu', 'Yang Yue', 'Tong Wu', 'Quentin Xu', 'Yang Yue', 'Matthieu Lin', 'Shenzhi Wang', 'Qingyun Wu', 'Zilong Zheng', 'Gao Huang']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.





## Extending a Quantum Reinforcement Learning Exploration Policy with Flags to Connect Four
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04371v1
- **Authors**: ['Filipe Santos', 'João Paulo Fernandes', 'Luís Macedo']
- **Abstrat**: Action selection based on flags is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) exploration policy that improves the exploration of the state space through the use of flags, which can identify the most promising actions to take in each state. The quantum counterpart of this exploration policy further improves upon this by taking advantage of a quadratic speedup for sampling flagged actions. This approach has already been successfully employed for the game of Checkers. In this work, we describe the application of this method to the context of Connect Four, in order to study its performance in a different setting, which can lead to a better generalization of the technique. We also kept track of a metric that wasn't taken into account in previous work: the average number of iterations to obtain a flagged action. Since going second is a significant disadvantage in Connect Four, we also had the intent of exploring how this more complex scenario would impact the performance of our approach. The experiments involved training and testing classical and quantum RL agents that played either going first or going second against a Randomized Negamax opponent. The results showed that both flagged exploration policies were clearly superior to a simple epsilon-greedy policy. Furthermore, the quantum agents did in fact sample flagged actions in less iterations. Despite obtaining tagged actions more consistently, the win rates between the classical and quantum versions of the approach were identical, which could be due to the simplicity of the training scenario chosen.





## Deep Learning Innovations for Energy Efficiency: Advances in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring and EV Charging Optimization for a Sustainable Grid
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04367v1
- **Authors**: ['Stavros Sykiotis']
- **Abstrat**: The global energy landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, often referred to as the energy transition, driven by the urgent need to mitigate climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and ensure sustainable energy supplies. However, the undoubted complexity of new investments in renewables, as well as the phase out of high CO2-emission energy sources, hampers the pace of the energy transition and raises doubts as to whether new renewable energy sources are capable of solely meeting the climate target goals. This highlights the need to investigate alternative pathways to accelerate the energy transition, by identifying human activity domains with higher/excessive energy demands. Two notable examples where there is room for improvement, in the sense of reducing energy consumption and consequently CO2 emissions, are residential energy consumption and road transport. This dissertation investigates the development of novel Deep Learning techniques to create tools which solve limitations in these two key energy domains. Reduction of residential energy consumption can be achieved by empowering end-users with the user of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring, whereas optimization of EV charging with Deep Reinforcement Learning can tackle road transport decarbonization.





## Adaptive and Robust DBSCAN with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04339v1
- **Authors**: ['Hao Peng', 'Xiang Huang', 'Shuo Sun', 'Ruitong Zhang', 'Philip S. Yu']
- **Abstrat**: DBSCAN, a well-known density-based clustering algorithm, has gained widespread popularity and usage due to its effectiveness in identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noisy data. However, it encounters challenges in producing satisfactory cluster results when confronted with datasets of varying density scales, a common scenario in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive and Robust DBSCAN with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning cluster framework, namely AR-DBSCAN. First, we model the initial dataset as a two-level encoding tree and categorize the data vertices into distinct density partitions according to the information uncertainty determined in the encoding tree. Each partition is then assigned to an agent to find the best clustering parameters without manual assistance. The allocation is density-adaptive, enabling AR-DBSCAN to effectively handle diverse density distributions within the dataset by utilizing distinct agents for different partitions. Second, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning guided automatic parameter searching process is designed. The process of adjusting the parameter search direction by perceiving the clustering environment is modeled as a Markov decision process. Using a weakly-supervised reward training policy network, each agent adaptively learns the optimal clustering parameters by interacting with the clusters. Third, a recursive search mechanism adaptable to the data's scale is presented, enabling efficient and controlled exploration of large parameter spaces. Extensive experiments are conducted on nine artificial datasets and a real-world dataset. The results of offline and online tasks show that AR-DBSCAN not only improves clustering accuracy by up to 144.1% and 175.3% in the NMI and ARI metrics, respectively, but also is capable of robustly finding dominant parameters.





## Mastering Multi-Drone Volleyball through Hierarchical Co-Self-Play Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04317v1
- **Authors**: ['Ruize Zhang', 'Sirui Xiang', 'Zelai Xu', 'Feng Gao', 'Shilong Ji', 'Wenhao Tang', 'Wenbo Ding', 'Chao Yu', 'Yu Wang']
- **Abstrat**: In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9\% win rate and a 71.5\% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.





## Flow Models for Unbounded and Geometry-Aware Distributional Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04310v1
- **Authors**: ['Simo Alami C.', 'Rim Kaddah', 'Jesse Read', 'Marie-Paule Cani']
- **Abstrat**: We introduce a new architecture for Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) that models return distributions using normalizing flows. This approach enables flexible, unbounded support for return distributions, in contrast to categorical approaches like C51 that rely on fixed or bounded representations. It also offers richer modeling capacity to capture multi-modality, skewness, and tail behavior than quantile based approaches. Our method is significantly more parameter-efficient than categorical approaches. Standard metrics used to train existing models like KL divergence or Wasserstein distance either are scale insensitive or have biased sample gradients, especially when return supports do not overlap. To address this, we propose a novel surrogate for the Cram\`er distance, that is geometry-aware and computable directly from the return distribution's PDF, avoiding the costly CDF computation. We test our model on the ATARI-5 sub-benchmark and show that our approach outperforms PDF based models while remaining competitive with quantile based methods.





## PPO-ACT: Proximal Policy Optimization with Adversarial Curriculum Transfer for Spatial Public Goods Games
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04302v1
- **Authors**: ['Zhaoqilin Yang', 'Chanchan Li', 'Xin Wang', 'Youliang Tian']
- **Abstrat**: This study investigates cooperation evolution mechanisms in the spatial public goods game. A novel deep reinforcement learning framework, Proximal Policy Optimization with Adversarial Curriculum Transfer (PPO-ACT), is proposed to model agent strategy optimization in dynamic environments. Traditional evolutionary game models frequently exhibit limitations in modeling long-term decision-making processes. Deep reinforcement learning effectively addresses this limitation by bridging policy gradient methods with evolutionary game theory. Our study pioneers the application of proximal policy optimization's continuous strategy optimization capability to public goods games through a two-stage adversarial curriculum transfer training paradigm. The experimental results show that PPO-ACT performs better in critical enhancement factor regimes. Compared to conventional standard proximal policy optimization methods, Q-learning and Fermi update rules, achieve earlier cooperation phase transitions and maintain stable cooperative equilibria. This framework exhibits better robustness when handling challenging scenarios like all-defector initial conditions. Systematic comparisons reveal the unique advantage of policy gradient methods in population-scale cooperation, i.e., achieving spatiotemporal payoff coordination through value function propagation. Our work provides a new computational framework for studying cooperation emergence in complex systems, algorithmically validating the punishment promotes cooperation hypothesis while offering methodological insights for multi-agent system strategy design.





## SimpleRL-Zoo: Investigating and Taming Zero Reinforcement Learning for Open Base Models in the Wild

- **Authors**: ['Weihao Zeng', 'Yuzhen Huang', 'Qian Liu', 'Wei Liu', 'Keqing He', 'Zejun Ma', 'Junxian He']
- **Abstrat**: DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.

## Graph-based Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Parking
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12616v2
- **Authors**: ['Farhad Nawaz', 'Minjun Sung', 'Darshan Gadginmath', "Jovin D'sa", 'Sangjae Bae', 'David Isele', 'Nadia Figueroa', 'Nikolai Matni', 'Faizan M. Tariq']
- **Abstrat**: Safe and efficient path planning in parking scenarios presents a significant challenge due to the presence of cluttered environments filled with static and dynamic obstacles. To address this, we propose a novel and computationally efficient planning strategy that seamlessly integrates the predictions of dynamic obstacles into the planning process, ensuring the generation of collision-free paths. Our approach builds upon the conventional Hybrid A star algorithm by introducing a time-indexed variant that explicitly accounts for the predictions of dynamic obstacles during node exploration in the graph, thus enabling dynamic obstacle avoidance. We integrate the time-indexed Hybrid A star algorithm within an online planning framework to compute local paths at each planning step, guided by an adaptively chosen intermediate goal. The proposed method is validated in diverse parking scenarios, including perpendicular, angled, and parallel parking. Through simulations, we showcase our approach's potential in greatly improving the efficiency and safety when compared to the state of the art spline-based planning method for parking situations.





## Can LLM be a Good Path Planner based on Prompt Engineering? Mitigating the Hallucination for Path Planning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13184v3
- **Authors**: ['Hourui Deng', 'Hongjie Zhang', 'Jie Ou', 'Chaosheng Feng']
- **Abstrat**: Spatial reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is the foundation for embodied intelligence. However, even in simple maze environments, LLMs still encounter challenges in long-term path-planning, primarily influenced by their spatial hallucination and context inconsistency hallucination by long-term reasoning. To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative model, Spatial-to-Relational Transformation and Curriculum Q-Learning (S2RCQL). To address the spatial hallucination of LLMs, we propose the Spatial-to-Relational approach, which transforms spatial prompts into entity relations and paths representing entity relation chains. This approach fully taps the potential of LLMs in terms of sequential thinking. As a result, we design a path-planning algorithm based on Q-learning to mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination, which enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Using the Q-value of state-action as auxiliary information for prompts, we correct the hallucinations of LLMs, thereby guiding LLMs to learn the optimal path. Finally, we propose a reverse curriculum learning technique based on LLMs to further mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination. LLMs can rapidly accumulate successful experiences by reducing task difficulty and leveraging them to tackle more complex tasks. We performed comprehensive experiments based on Baidu's self-developed LLM: ERNIE-Bot 4.0. The results showed that our S2RCQL achieved a 23%--40% improvement in both success and optimality rates compared with advanced prompt engineering.
