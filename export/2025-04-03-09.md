- **Abstrat**: Since the advent of reasoning-based large language models, many have found great success from distilling reasoning capabilities into student models. Such techniques have significantly bridged the gap between reasoning and standard LLMs on coding tasks. Despite this, much of the progress on distilling reasoning models remains locked behind proprietary datasets or lacks details on data curation, filtering and subsequent training. To address this, we construct a superior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset that we use to achieve state-of-the-art coding capability results in models of various sizes. Our distilled models use only SFT to achieve 61.8% on LiveCodeBench and 24.6% on CodeContests, surpassing alternatives trained with reinforcement learning. We then perform analysis on the data sources used to construct our dataset, the impact of code execution filtering, and the importance of instruction/solution diversity. We observe that execution filtering negatively affected benchmark accuracy, leading us to prioritize instruction diversity over solution correctness. Finally, we also analyze the token efficiency and reasoning patterns utilized by these models. We will open-source these datasets and distilled models to the community.

- **Abstrat**: Policy optimization seeks the best solution to a control problem according to an objective or fitness function, serving as a fundamental field of engineering and research with applications in robotics. Traditional optimization methods like reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms struggle with deceptive fitness landscapes, where following immediate improvements leads to suboptimal solutions. Quality-diversity (QD) algorithms offer a promising approach by maintaining diverse intermediate solutions as stepping stones for escaping local optima. However, QD algorithms require domain expertise to define hand-crafted features, limiting their applicability where characterizing solution diversity remains unclear. In this paper, we show that unsupervised QD algorithms - specifically the AURORA framework, which learns features from sensory data - efficiently solve deceptive optimization problems without domain expertise. By enhancing AURORA with contrastive learning and periodic extinction events, we propose AURORA-XCon, which outperforms all traditional optimization baselines and matches, in some cases even improving by up to 34%, the best QD baseline with domain-specific hand-crafted features. This work establishes a novel application of unsupervised QD algorithms, shifting their focus from discovering novel solutions toward traditional optimization and expanding their potential to domains where defining feature spaces poses challenges.

- **Abstrat**: Physical AI systems need to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world. In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that can understand the physical world and generate appropriate embodied decisions (e.g., next step action) in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI reasoning, with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To represent physical common sense, we use a hierarchical ontology that captures fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning, we rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different physical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal large language models, Cosmos-Reason1-8B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data and train our models in four stages: vision pre-training, general supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL) as the post-training. To evaluate our models, we build comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and reinforcement learning bring significant improvements. To facilitate the development of Physical AI, we will make our code and pre-trained models available under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1.

- **Abstrat**: Recent advances in general medical AI have made significant strides, but existing models often lack the reasoning capabilities needed for complex medical decision-making. This paper presents GMAI-VL-R1, a multimodal medical reasoning model enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve its reasoning abilities. Through iterative training, GMAI-VL-R1 optimizes decision-making, significantly boosting diagnostic accuracy and clinical support. We also develop a reasoning data synthesis method, generating step-by-step reasoning data via rejection sampling, which further enhances the model's generalization. Experimental results show that after RL training, GMAI-VL-R1 excels in tasks such as medical image diagnosis and visual question answering. While the model demonstrates basic memorization with supervised fine-tuning, RL is crucial for true generalization. Our work establishes new evaluation benchmarks and paves the way for future advancements in medical reasoning models. Code, data, and model will be released at \href{https://github.com/uni-medical/GMAI-VL-R1}{this link}.





## Efficient Imitation under Misspecification
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13162v2
- **Authors**: ['Nicolas Espinosa-Dice', 'Sanjiban Choudhury', 'Wen Sun', 'Gokul Swamy']
- **Abstrat**: We consider the problem of imitation learning under misspecification: settings where the learner is fundamentally unable to replicate expert behavior everywhere. This is often true in practice due to differences in observation space and action space expressiveness (e.g. perceptual or morphological differences between robots and humans). Given the learner must make some mistakes in the misspecified setting, interaction with the environment is fundamentally required to figure out which mistakes are particularly costly and lead to compounding errors. However, given the computational cost and safety concerns inherent in interaction, we'd like to perform as little of it as possible while ensuring we've learned a strong policy. Accordingly, prior work has proposed a flavor of efficient inverse reinforcement learning algorithms that merely perform a computationally efficient local search procedure with strong guarantees in the realizable setting. We first prove that under a novel structural condition we term reward-agnostic policy completeness, these sorts of local-search based IRL algorithms are able to avoid compounding errors. We then consider the question of where we should perform local search in the first place, given the learner may not be able to "walk on a tightrope" as well as the expert in the misspecified setting. We prove that in the misspecified setting, it is beneficial to broaden the set of states on which local search is performed to include those reachable by good policies the learner can actually play. We then experimentally explore a variety of sources of misspecification and how offline data can be used to effectively broaden where we perform local search from.





## Interpreting Emergent Planning in Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01871v1
- **Authors**: ['Thomas Bush', 'Stephen Chung', 'Usman Anwar', 'Adri√† Garriga-Alonso', 'David Krueger']
- **Abstrat**: We present the first mechanistic evidence that model-free reinforcement learning agents can learn to plan. This is achieved by applying a methodology based on concept-based interpretability to a model-free agent in Sokoban -- a commonly used benchmark for studying planning. Specifically, we demonstrate that DRC, a generic model-free agent introduced by Guez et al. (2019), uses learned concept representations to internally formulate plans that both predict the long-term effects of actions on the environment and influence action selection. Our methodology involves: (1) probing for planning-relevant concepts, (2) investigating plan formation within the agent's representations, and (3) verifying that discovered plans (in the agent's representations) have a causal effect on the agent's behavior through interventions. We also show that the emergence of these plans coincides with the emergence of a planning-like property: the ability to benefit from additional test-time compute. Finally, we perform a qualitative analysis of the planning algorithm learned by the agent and discover a strong resemblance to parallelized bidirectional search. Our findings advance understanding of the internal mechanisms underlying planning behavior in agents, which is important given the recent trend of emergent planning and reasoning capabilities in LLMs through RL





## Reconciling Early and Late Time Tensions with Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04204v2
- **Authors**: ['Mohit K. Sharma', 'M. Sami']
- **Abstrat**: We study the possibility of accommodating both early and late-time tensions using a novel reinforcement learning technique. By applying this technique, we aim to optimize the evolution of the Hubble parameter from recombination to the present epoch, addressing both tensions simultaneously. To maximize the goodness of fit, our learning technique achieves a fit that surpasses even the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results demonstrate a tendency to weaken both early and late time tensions in a completely model-independent manner.





## Learning with Imperfect Models: When Multi-step Prediction Mitigates Compounding Error
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01766v1
- **Authors**: ['Anne Somalwar', 'Bruce D. Lee', 'George J. Pappas', 'Nikolai Matni']
- **Abstrat**: Compounding error, where small prediction mistakes accumulate over time, presents a major challenge in learning-based control. For example, this issue often limits the performance of model-based reinforcement learning and imitation learning. One common approach to mitigate compounding error is to train multi-step predictors directly, rather than relying on autoregressive rollout of a single-step model. However, it is not well understood when the benefits of multi-step prediction outweigh the added complexity of learning a more complicated model. In this work, we provide a rigorous analysis of this trade-off in the context of linear dynamical systems. We show that when the model class is well-specified and accurately captures the system dynamics, single-step models achieve lower asymptotic prediction error. On the other hand, when the model class is misspecified due to partial observability, direct multi-step predictors can significantly reduce bias and thus outperform single-step approaches. These theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, wherein we also (a) empirically evaluate an intermediate strategy which trains a single-step model using a multi-step loss and (b) evaluate performance of single step and multi-step predictors in a closed loop control setting.





## Beyond Non-Expert Demonstrations: Outcome-Driven Action Constraint for Offline Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01719v1
- **Authors**: ['Ke Jiang', 'Wen Jiang', 'Yao Li', 'Xiaoyang Tan']
- **Abstrat**: We address the challenge of offline reinforcement learning using realistic data, specifically non-expert data collected through sub-optimal behavior policies. Under such circumstance, the learned policy must be safe enough to manage \textit{distribution shift} while maintaining sufficient flexibility to deal with non-expert (bad) demonstrations from offline data.To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel method called Outcome-Driven Action Flexibility (ODAF), which seeks to reduce reliance on the empirical action distribution of the behavior policy, hence reducing the negative impact of those bad demonstrations.To be specific, a new conservative reward mechanism is developed to deal with {\it distribution shift} by evaluating actions according to whether their outcomes meet safety requirements - remaining within the state support area, rather than solely depending on the actions' likelihood based on offline data.Besides theoretical justification, we provide empirical evidence on widely used MuJoCo and various maze benchmarks, demonstrating that our ODAF method, implemented using uncertainty quantification techniques, effectively tolerates unseen transitions for improved "trajectory stitching," while enhancing the agent's ability to learn from realistic non-expert data.





## Exploring Data Scaling Trends and Effects in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22230v3
- **Authors**: ['Wei Shen', 'Guanlin Liu', 'Zheng Wu', 'Ruofei Zhu', 'Qingping Yang', 'Chao Xin', 'Yu Yue', 'Lin Yan']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning large language models with human preferences. While recent research has focused on algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has been overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven bottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and decreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to mitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method, Pre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness. Additionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in RLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model sizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that RTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth, and then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid capture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial improvements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance of careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome performance barriers in RLHF.





## ToM-RL: Reinforcement Learning Unlocks Theory of Mind in Small LLMs
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01698v1
- **Authors**: ['Yi-Long Lu', 'Chunhui Zhang', 'Jiajun Song', 'Lifeng Fan', 'Wei Wang']
- **Abstrat**: Recent advancements in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), applied during the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced their capabilities in structured reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logical inference. However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.





## Learning Dual-Arm Push and Grasp Synergy in Dense Clutter
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04052v2
- **Authors**: ['Yongliang Wang', 'Hamidreza Kasaei']
- **Abstrat**: Robotic grasping in densely cluttered environments is challenging due to scarce collision-free grasp affordances. Non-prehensile actions can increase feasible grasps in cluttered environments, but most research focuses on single-arm rather than dual-arm manipulation. Policies from single-arm systems fail to fully leverage the advantages of dual-arm coordination. We propose a target-oriented hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that learns dual-arm push-grasp synergy for grasping objects to enhance dexterous manipulation in dense clutter. Our framework maps visual observations to actions via a pre-trained deep learning backbone and a novel CNN-based DRL model, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to develop a dual-arm push-grasp strategy. The backbone enhances feature mapping in densely cluttered environments. A novel fuzzy-based reward function is introduced to accelerate efficient strategy learning. Our system is developed and trained in Isaac Gym and then tested in simulations and on a real robot. Experimental results show that our framework effectively maps visual data to dual push-grasp motions, enabling the dual-arm system to grasp target objects in complex environments. Compared to other methods, our approach generates 6-DoF grasp candidates and enables dual-arm push actions, mimicking human behavior. Results show that our method efficiently completes tasks in densely cluttered environments. https://sites.google.com/view/pg4da/home





## A Robust Model-Based Approach for Continuous-Time Policy Evaluation with Unknown L√©vy Process Dynamics
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01482v1
- **Authors**: ['Qihao Ye', 'Xiaochuan Tian', 'Yuhua Zhu']
- **Abstrat**: This paper develops a model-based framework for continuous-time policy evaluation (CTPE) in reinforcement learning, incorporating both Brownian and L\'evy noise to model stochastic dynamics influenced by rare and extreme events. Our approach formulates the policy evaluation problem as solving a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) for the value function with unknown coefficients. A key challenge in this setting is accurately recovering the unknown coefficients in the stochastic dynamics, particularly when driven by L\'evy processes with heavy tail effects. To address this, we propose a robust numerical approach that effectively handles both unbiased and censored trajectory datasets. This method combines maximum likelihood estimation with an iterative tail correction mechanism, improving the stability and accuracy of coefficient recovery. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound for the policy evaluation error based on coefficient recovery error. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in recovering heavy-tailed L\'evy dynamics and verify the theoretical error analysis in policy evaluation.





## Mastering truss structure optimization with tree search
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06145v5
- **Authors**: ['Gabriel Garayalde', 'Luca Rosafalco', 'Matteo Torzoni', 'Alberto Corigliano']
- **Abstrat**: This study investigates the combined use of generative grammar rules and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for optimizing truss structures. Our approach accommodates intermediate construction stages characteristic of progressive construction settings. We demonstrate the significant robustness and computational efficiency of our approach compared to alternative reinforcement learning frameworks from previous research activities, such as Q-learning or deep Q-learning. These advantages stem from the ability of MCTS to strategically navigate large state spaces, leveraging the upper confidence bound for trees formula to effectively balance exploitation-exploration trade-offs. We also emphasize the importance of early decision nodes in the search tree, reflecting design choices crucial for highly performative solutions. Additionally, we show how MCTS dynamically adapts to complex and extensive state spaces without significantly affecting solution quality. While the focus of this paper is on truss optimization, our findings suggest MCTS as a powerful tool for addressing other increasingly complex engineering applications.





## Probabilistic Curriculum Learning for Goal-Based Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01459v1
- **Authors**: ['Llewyn Salt', 'Marcus Gallagher']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) -- algorithms that teach artificial agents to interact with environments by maximising reward signals -- has achieved significant success in recent years. These successes have been facilitated by advances in algorithms (e.g., deep Q-learning, deep deterministic policy gradients, proximal policy optimisation, trust region policy optimisation, and soft actor-critic) and specialised computational resources such as GPUs and TPUs. One promising research direction involves introducing goals to allow multimodal policies, commonly through hierarchical or curriculum reinforcement learning. These methods systematically decompose complex behaviours into simpler sub-tasks, analogous to how humans progressively learn skills (e.g. we learn to run before we walk, or we learn arithmetic before calculus). However, fully automating goal creation remains an open challenge. We present a novel probabilistic curriculum learning algorithm to suggest goals for reinforcement learning agents in continuous control and navigation tasks.





## AgentForge: A Flexible Low-Code Platform for Reinforcement Learning Agent Design
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19528v4
- **Authors**: ['Francisco Erivaldo Fernandes Junior', 'Antti Oulasvirta']
- **Abstrat**: Developing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent often involves identifying values for numerous parameters, covering the policy, reward function, environment, and agent-internal architecture. Since these parameters are interrelated in complex ways, optimizing them is a black-box problem that proves especially challenging for nonexperts. Although existing optimization-as-a-service platforms (e.g., Vizier and Optuna) can handle such problems, they are impractical for RL systems, since the need for manual user mapping of each parameter to distinct components makes the effort cumbersome. It also requires understanding of the optimization process, limiting the systems' application beyond the machine learning field and restricting access in areas such as cognitive science, which models human decision-making. To tackle these challenges, the paper presents AgentForge, a flexible low-code platform to optimize any parameter set across an RL system. Available at https://github.com/feferna/AgentForge, it allows an optimization problem to be defined in a few lines of code and handed to any of the interfaced optimizers. With AgentForge, the user can optimize the parameters either individually or jointly. The paper presents an evaluation of its performance for a challenging vision-based RL problem.





## Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Enabled Multi-User Secure Communications
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01446v1
- **Authors**: ['Xiao Tang', 'Kexin Zhao', 'Chao Shen', 'Qinghe Du', 'Yichen Wang', 'Dusit Niyato', 'Zhu Han']
- **Abstrat**: While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility are envisioned to enhance physical layer security in wireless communications, the efficient security design that adapts to such high network dynamics is rather challenging. The conventional approaches extended from optimization perspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering factors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related scenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure communications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network (GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through the message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security beamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security performance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy determination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers a scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations, establishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled communications.

- **Authors**: ['Juan Bravo-Arrabal', 'Ricardo V√°zquez-Mart√≠n', 'J. J. Fern√°ndez-Lozano', 'Alfonso Garc√≠a-Cerezo']
- **Abstrat**: This paper presents field-tested use cases from Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, highlighting the co-design of mobile robots and communication systems to support Edge-Cloud architectures based on 5G Standalone (SA). The main goal is to contribute to the effective cooperation of multiple robots and first responders. Our field experience includes the development of Hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks (H-WSNs) for risk and victim detection, smartphones integrated into the Robot Operating System (ROS) as Edge devices for mission requests and path planning, real-time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) via Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), and implementation of Uncrewed Ground Vehicles (UGVs) for victim evacuation in different navigation modes. These experiments, conducted in collaboration with actual first responders, underscore the need for intelligent network resource management, balancing low-latency and high-bandwidth demands. Network slicing is key to ensuring critical emergency services are performed despite challenging communication conditions. The paper identifies architectural needs, lessons learned, and challenges to be addressed by 6G technologies to enhance emergency response capabilities.





## Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01851v1
- **Authors**: ['Marc Schneider', 'Renato Loureiro', 'Torbj√∏rn Cunis', 'Walter Fichter']
- **Abstrat**: Trajectory prediction of other vehicles is crucial for autonomous vehicles, with applications from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.
