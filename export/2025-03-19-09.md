- **Abstrat**: Inference scaling empowers LLMs with unprecedented reasoning ability, with reinforcement learning as the core technique to elicit complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed (such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results. We propose the $\textbf{D}$ecoupled Clip and $\textbf{D}$ynamic s$\textbf{A}$mpling $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{DAPO}$) algorithm, and fully open-source a state-of-the-art large-scale RL system that achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 using Qwen2.5-32B base model. Unlike previous works that withhold training details, we introduce four key techniques of our algorithm that make large-scale LLM RL a success. In addition, we open-source our training code, which is built on the verl framework, along with a carefully curated and processed dataset. These components of our open-source system enhance reproducibility and support future research in large-scale LLM RL.

- **Authors**: ['Ayushi Dubal', 'David Kremer', 'Simon Martiel', 'Victor Villar', 'Derek Wang', 'Juan Cruz-Benito']
- **Abstrat**: We introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based method for re-synthesis of quantum circuits containing arbitrary Pauli rotations alongside Clifford operations. By collapsing each sub-block to a compact representation and then synthesizing it step-by-step through a learned heuristic, we obtain circuits that are both shorter and compliant with hardware connectivity constraints. We find that the method is fast enough and good enough to work as an optimization procedure: in direct comparisons on 6-qubit random Pauli Networks against state-of-the-art heuristic methods, our RL approach yields over 2x reduction in two-qubit gate count, while executing in under 10 milliseconds per circuit. We further integrate the method into a collect-and-re-synthesize pipeline, applied as a Qiskit transpiler pass, where we observe average improvements of 20% in two-qubit gate count and depth, reaching up to 60% for many instances, across the Benchpress benchmark. These results highlight the potential of RL-driven synthesis to significantly improve circuit quality in realistic, large-scale quantum transpilation workloads.





## Unsynchronized Decentralized Q-Learning: Two Timescale Analysis By Persistence
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03239v2
- **Authors**: ['Bora Yongacoglu', 'Gürdal Arslan', 'Serdar Yüksel']
- **Abstrat**: Non-stationarity is a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents update their behaviour as they learn. Many theoretical advances in MARL avoid the challenge of non-stationarity by coordinating the policy updates of agents in various ways, including synchronizing times at which agents are allowed to revise their policies. Synchronization enables analysis of many MARL algorithms via multi-timescale methods, but such synchronization is infeasible in many decentralized applications. In this paper, we study an unsynchronized variant of the decentralized Q-learning algorithm, a recent MARL algorithm for stochastic games. We provide sufficient conditions under which the unsynchronized algorithm drives play to equilibrium with high probability. Our solution utilizes constant learning rates in the Q-factor update, which we show to be critical for relaxing the synchronization assumptions of earlier work. Our analysis also applies to unsynchronized generalizations of a number of other algorithms from the regret testing tradition, whose performance is analyzed by multi-timescale methods that study Markov chains obtained via policy update dynamics. This work extends the applicability of the decentralized Q-learning algorithm and its relatives to settings in which parameters are selected in an independent manner, and tames non-stationarity without imposing the coordination assumptions of prior work.





## A Graph-Enhanced Deep-Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Aircraft Landing Problem
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12617v2
- **Authors**: ['Vatsal Maru']
- **Abstrat**: The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is one of the challenging problems in aircraft transportation and management. The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95% reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38% higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management.





## IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12092v2
- **Authors**: ['Rui Liu', 'Zahiruddin Mahammad', 'Amisha Bhaskar', 'Pratap Tokekar']
- **Abstrat**: Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance. We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition. Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline. More details can be found on our website https://ruiiu.github.io/imrl.





## Flying in Highly Dynamic Environments with End-to-end Learning Approach
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14352v1
- **Authors**: ['Xiyu Fan', 'Minghao Lu', 'Bowen Xu', 'Peng Lu']
- **Abstrat**: Obstacle avoidance for unmanned aerial vehicles like quadrotors is a popular research topic. Most existing research focuses only on static environments, and obstacle avoidance in environments with multiple dynamic obstacles remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel deep-reinforcement learning-based approach for the quadrotors to navigate through highly dynamic environments. We propose a lidar data encoder to extract obstacle information from the massive point cloud data from the lidar. Multi frames of historical scans will be compressed into a 2-dimension obstacle map while maintaining the obstacle features required. An end-to-end deep neural network is trained to extract the kinematics of dynamic and static obstacles from the obstacle map, and it will generate acceleration commands to the quadrotor to control it to avoid these obstacles. Our approach contains perception and navigating functions in a single neural network, which can change from a navigating state into a hovering state without mode switching. We also present simulations and real-world experiments to show the effectiveness of our approach while navigating in highly dynamic cluttered environments.





## Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07933v2
- **Authors**: ['Carolin Schmidt', 'Daniele Gammelli', 'James Harrison', 'Marco Pavone', 'Filipe Rodrigues']
- **Abstrat**: Hierarchical policies enable strong performance in many sequential decision-making problems, such as those with high-dimensional action spaces, those requiring long-horizon planning, and settings with sparse rewards. However, learning hierarchical policies from static offline datasets presents a significant challenge. Crucially, actions taken by higher-level policies may not be directly observable within hierarchical controllers, and the offline dataset might have been generated using a different policy structure, hindering the use of standard offline learning algorithms. In this work, we propose OHIO: a framework for offline reinforcement learning (RL) of hierarchical policies. Our framework leverages knowledge of the policy structure to solve the \textit{inverse problem}, recovering the unobservable high-level actions that likely generated the observed data under our hierarchical policy. This approach constructs a dataset suitable for off-the-shelf offline training. We demonstrate our framework on robotic and network optimization problems and show that it substantially outperforms end-to-end RL methods and improves robustness. We investigate a variety of instantiations of our framework, both in direct deployment of policies trained offline and when online fine-tuning is performed. Code and data are available at https://ohio-offline-hierarchical-rl.github.io





## MANTRA: Enhancing Automated Method-Level Refactoring with Contextual RAG and Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14340v1
- **Authors**: ['Yisen Xu', 'Feng Lin', 'Jinqiu Yang', 'Tse-Hsun', 'Chen', 'Nikolaos Tsantalis']
- **Abstrat**: Maintaining and scaling software systems relies heavily on effective code refactoring, yet this process remains labor-intensive, requiring developers to carefully analyze existing codebases and prevent the introduction of new defects. Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution. In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring. MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability. Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations. Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations. A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.





## Revealing higher-order neural representations with generative artificial intelligence
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14333v1
- **Authors**: ['Hojjat Azimi Asrari', 'Megan A. K. Peters']
- **Abstrat**: Studies often aim to reveal how neural representations encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as its contents or structure. These are ``first-order" representations (FORs), because they're ``about" the external world. A less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are ``about" FORs -- their contents, stability, or uncertainty. HORs of uncertainty appear critically involved in adaptive behaviors including learning under uncertainty, influencing learning rates and internal model updating based on environmental feedback. However, HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting estimation processes which may be lossy, bias-prone, or distortive and which may also incorporate estimates of distributions of uncertainty the observer is likely to experience. While some research has targeted neural representations of ``instantaneously" estimated uncertainty, how the brain represents \textit{distributions} of expected uncertainty remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based generative artificial intelligence (genAI) approach to explore neural representations of uncertainty distributions. We use existing functional magnetic resonance imaging data, where humans learned to `de-noise' their brain states to achieve target neural patterns, to train denoising diffusion genAI models with RL algorithms to learn noise distributions similar to how humans might learn to do the same. We then explore these models' learned noise-distribution HORs compared to control models trained with traditional backpropagation. Results reveal model-dependent differences in noise distribution representations --with the RL-based model offering much higher explanatory power for human behavior -- offering an exciting path towards using genAI to explore neural noise-distribution HORs.





## Sublinear Regret for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear-Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17226v3
- **Authors**: ['Yilie Huang', 'Yanwei Jia', 'Xun Yu Zhou']
- **Abstrat**: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.





## Tapered Off-Policy REINFORCE: Stable and efficient reinforcement learning for LLMs

- **Authors**: ['Nicolas Le Roux', 'Marc G. Bellemare', 'Jonathan Lebensold', 'Arnaud Bergeron', 'Joshua Greaves', 'Alex Fréchette', 'Carolyne Pelletier', 'Eric Thibodeau-Laufer Sándor Toth', 'Samantha Work']
- **Abstrat**: We propose a new algorithm for fine-tuning large language models using reinforcement learning. Tapered Off-Policy REINFORCE (TOPR) uses an asymmetric, tapered variant of importance sampling to speed up learning while maintaining stable learning dynamics, even without the use of KL regularization. TOPR can be applied in a fully offline fashion, allows the handling of positive and negative examples in a unified framework, and benefits from the implementational simplicity that is typical of Monte Carlo algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments on the GSM8K and MATH reasoning benchmarks, finding performance gains for training both a model for solution generation and as a generative verifier. We show that properly leveraging positive and negative examples alike in the off-policy regime simultaneously increases test-time accuracy and training data efficiency, all the while avoiding the ``wasted inference'' that comes with discarding negative examples. We find that this advantage persists over multiple iterations of training and can be amplified by dataset curation techniques, enabling us to match 70B-parameter model performance with 8B language models. As a corollary to this work, we find that REINFORCE's baseline parameter plays an important and unexpected role in defining dataset composition in the presence of negative examples, and is consequently critical in driving off-policy performance.





## Integral modelling and Reinforcement Learning control of 3D liquid metal coating on a moving substrate
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14270v1
- **Authors**: ['Fabio Pino', 'Edoardo Fracchia', 'Benoit Scheid', 'Miguel A. Mendez']
- **Abstrat**: Metallic coatings are used to improve the durability of metal surfaces, protecting them from corrosion. These protective layers are typically deposited in a fluid state via a liquid film. Controlling instabilities in the liquid film is crucial for achieving uniform and high-quality coatings. This study explores the possibility of controlling liquid films on a moving substrate using a combination of gas jets and electromagnetic actuators. To model the 3D liquid film, we extend existing integral models to incorporate the effects of electromagnetic actuators. The control strategy was developed within a reinforcement learning framework, where the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm interacts with the liquid film via pneumatic and electromagnetic actuators to optimize a reward function, accounting for the amplitude of the instability waves through a trial and error process. The PPO found an optimal control law, which successfully reduced interface instabilities through a novel control mechanism, where gas jets push crests and electromagnets raise troughs using the Lorentz force.

- **Abstrat**: As free-space optical systems grow in scale and complexity, troubleshooting becomes increasingly time-consuming and, in the case of remote installations, perhaps impractical. An example of a task that is often laborious is the alignment of a high-finesse optical resonator, which is highly sensitive to the mode of the input beam. In this work, we demonstrate how machine learning can be used to achieve autonomous mode-matching of a free-space optical resonator with minimal supervision. Our approach leverages sample-efficient algorithms to reduce data requirements while maintaining a simple architecture for easy deployment. The reinforcement learning scheme that we have developed shows that automation is feasible even in systems prone to drift in experimental parameters, as may well be the case in real-world applications.





## CTSAC: Curriculum-Based Transformer Soft Actor-Critic for Goal-Oriented Robot Exploration
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14254v1
- **Authors**: ['Chunyu Yang', 'Shengben Bi', 'Yihui Xu', 'Xin Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: With the increasing demand for efficient and flexible robotic exploration solutions, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is becoming a promising approach in the field of autonomous robotic exploration. However, current RL-based exploration algorithms often face limited environmental reasoning capabilities, slow convergence rates, and substantial challenges in Sim-To-Real (S2R) transfer. To address these issues, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Transformer Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (CTSAC) aimed at improving both exploration efficiency and transfer performance. To enhance the robot's reasoning ability, a Transformer is integrated into the perception network of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, leveraging historical information to improve the farsightedness of the strategy. A periodic review-based curriculum learning is proposed, which enhances training efficiency while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during curriculum transitions. Training is conducted on the ROS-Gazebo continuous robotic simulation platform, with LiDAR clustering optimization to further reduce the S2R gap. Experimental results demonstrate the CTSAC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art non-learning and learning-based algorithms in terms of success rate and success rate-weighted exploration time. Moreover, real-world experiments validate the strong S2R transfer capabilities of CTSAC.





## IGDrivSim: A Benchmark for the Imitation Gap in Autonomous Driving
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04653v2
- **Authors**: ['Clémence Grislain', 'Risto Vuorio', 'Cong Lu', 'Shimon Whiteson']
- **Abstrat**: Developing autonomous vehicles that can navigate complex environments with human-level safety and efficiency is a central goal in self-driving research. A common approach to achieving this is imitation learning, where agents are trained to mimic human expert demonstrations collected from real-world driving scenarios. However, discrepancies between human perception and the self-driving car's sensors can introduce an $\textit{imitation}$ gap, leading to imitation learning failures. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{IGDrivSim}$, a benchmark built on top of the Waymax simulator, designed to investigate the effects of the imitation gap in learning autonomous driving policy from human expert demonstrations. Our experiments show that this perception gap between human experts and self-driving agents can hinder the learning of safe and effective driving behaviors. We further show that combining imitation with reinforcement learning, using a simple penalty reward for prohibited behaviors, effectively mitigates these failures. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/clemgris/IGDrivSim.git.





## A Parallel Hybrid Action Space Reinforcement Learning Model for Real-world Adaptive Traffic Signal Control
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14250v1
- **Authors**: ['Yuxuan Wang', 'Meng Long', 'Qiang Wu', 'Wei Liu', 'Jiatian Pi', 'Xinmin Yang']
- **Abstrat**: Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) can effectively reduce vehicle travel times by dynamically adjusting signal timings but poses a critical challenge in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of real-time decision-making in dynamic and uncertain traffic conditions. The burgeoning field of intelligent transportation systems, bolstered by artificial intelligence techniques and extensive data availability, offers new prospects for the implementation of ATSC. In this study, we introduce a parallel hybrid action space reinforcement learning model (PH-DDPG) that optimizes traffic signal phase and duration of traffic signals simultaneously, eliminating the need for sequential decision-making seen in traditional two-stage models. Our model features a task-specific parallel hybrid action space tailored for adaptive traffic control, which directly outputs discrete phase selections and their associated continuous duration parameters concurrently, thereby inherently addressing dynamic traffic adaptation through unified parametric optimization. %Our model features a unique parallel hybrid action space that allows for the simultaneous output of each action and its optimal parameters, streamlining the decision-making process. Furthermore, to ascertain the robustness and effectiveness of this approach, we executed ablation studies focusing on the utilization of a random action parameter mask within the critic network, which decouples the parameter space for individual actions, facilitating the use of preferable parameters for each action. The results from these studies confirm the efficacy of this method, distinctly enhancing real-world applicability





## Curriculum Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion and Consistency Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13637v4
- **Authors**: ['Florinel-Alin Croitoru', 'Vlad Hondru', 'Radu Tudor Ionescu', 'Nicu Sebe', 'Mubarak Shah']
- **Abstrat**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference. Our code is available at https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/Curriculum-DPO.





## SPEQ: Offline Stabilization Phases for Efficient Q-Learning in High Update-To-Data Ratio Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08669v2
- **Authors**: ['Carlo Romeo', 'Girolamo Macaluso', 'Alessandro Sestini', 'Andrew D. Bagdanov']
- **Abstrat**: High update-to-data (UTD) ratio algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL) improve sample efficiency but incur high computational costs, limiting real-world scalability. We propose Offline Stabilization Phases for Efficient Q-Learning (SPEQ), an RL algorithm that combines low-UTD online training with periodic offline stabilization phases. During these phases, Q-functions are fine-tuned with high UTD ratios on a fixed replay buffer, reducing redundant updates on suboptimal data. This structured training schedule optimally balances computational and sample efficiency, addressing the limitations of both high and low UTD ratio approaches. We empirically demonstrate that SPEQ requires from 40% to 99% fewer gradient updates and 27% to 78% less training time compared to state-of-the-art high UTD ratio methods while maintaining or surpassing their performance on the MuJoCo continuous control benchmark. Our findings highlight the potential of periodic stabilization phases as an effective alternative to conventional training schedules, paving the way for more scalable reinforcement learning solutions in real-world applications where computational resources are constrained.

- **Abstrat**: Efficient material logistics play a critical role in controlling costs and schedules in the construction industry. However, manual material handling remains prone to inefficiencies, delays, and safety risks. Autonomous forklifts offer a promising solution to streamline on-site logistics, reducing reliance on human operators and mitigating labor shortages. This paper presents the development and evaluation of the Autonomous Dynamic All-terrain Pallet Transporter (ADAPT), a fully autonomous off-road forklift designed for construction environments. Unlike structured warehouse settings, construction sites pose significant challenges, including dynamic obstacles, unstructured terrain, and varying weather conditions. To address these challenges, our system integrates AI-driven perception techniques with traditional approaches for decision making, planning, and control, enabling reliable operation in complex environments. We validate the system through extensive real-world testing, comparing its long-term performance against an experienced human operator across various weather conditions. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of challenges and key lessons learned, contributing to the advancement of autonomous heavy machinery. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous outdoor forklifts can operate near human-level performance, offering a viable path toward safer and more efficient construction logistics.





## Dynamic Programming-Based Offline Redundancy Resolution of Redundant Manipulators Along Prescribed Paths with Real-Time Adjustment
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17052v2
- **Authors**: ['Zhihang Yin', 'Fa Wu', 'Ziqian Wang', 'Jianmin Yang', 'Jiyong Tan', 'Dexing Kong']
- **Abstrat**: Traditional offline redundancy resolution of trajectories for redundant manipulators involves computing inverse kinematic solutions for Cartesian space paths, constraining the manipulator to a fixed path without real-time adjustments. Online redundancy resolution can achieve real-time adjustment of paths, but it cannot consider subsequent path points, leading to the possibility of the manipulator being forced to stop mid-motion due to joint constraints. To address this, this paper introduces a dynamic programming-based offline redundancy resolution for redundant manipulators along prescribed paths with real-time adjustment. The proposed method allows the manipulator to move along a prescribed path while implementing real-time adjustment along the normal to the path. Using Dynamic Programming, the proposed approach computes a global maximum for the variation of adjustment coefficients. As long as the coefficient variation between adjacent sampling path points does not exceed this limit, the algorithm provides the next path point's joint angles based on the current joint angles, enabling the end-effector to achieve the adjusted Cartesian pose. The main innovation of this paper lies in augmenting traditional offline optimal planning with real-time adjustment capabilities, achieving a fusion of offline planning and online planning.





## GPU-Accelerated Motion Planning of an Underactuated Forestry Crane in Cluttered Environments

- **Authors**: ['Minh Nhat Vu', 'Gerald Ebmer', 'Alexander Watcher', 'Marc-Philip Ecker', 'Giang Nguyen', 'Tobias Glueck']
- **Abstrat**: Autonomous large-scale machine operations require fast, efficient, and collision-free motion planning while addressing unique challenges such as hydraulic actuation limits and underactuated joint dynamics. This paper presents a novel two-step motion planning framework designed for an underactuated forestry crane. The first step employs GPU-accelerated stochastic optimization to rapidly compute a globally shortest collision-free path. The second step refines this path into a dynamically feasible trajectory using a trajectory optimizer that ensures compliance with system dynamics and actuation constraints. The proposed approach is benchmarked against conventional techniques, including RRT-based methods and purely optimization-based approaches. Simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements in computation speed and motion feasibility, making this method highly suitable for complex crane systems.
