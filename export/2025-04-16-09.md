- **Abstrat**: The capacity for complex mathematical reasoning is a key benchmark for artificial intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) applied to LLMs shows promise, progress is significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale training data that is sufficiently challenging, possesses verifiable answer formats suitable for RL, and is free from contamination with evaluation benchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new, large-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems, specifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K is curated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent decontamination against numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty (primarily Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding existing open resources in challenge. Each problem includes a verifiable final answer, enabling rule-based RL, and three distinct R1-generated solutions suitable for diverse training paradigms like supervised fine-tuning or distillation. Spanning a wide range of mathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the development of generalizable reasoning. We demonstrate that models trained on DeepMath-103K achieve significant improvements on challenging mathematical benchmarks, validating its effectiveness. We release DeepMath-103K publicly to facilitate community progress in building more capable AI reasoning systems: https://github.com/zwhe99/DeepMath.





## A Clean Slate for Offline Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11453v1
- **Authors**: ['Matthew Thomas Jackson', 'Uljad Berdica', 'Jarek Liesen', 'Shimon Whiteson', 'Jakob Nicolaus Foerster']
- **Abstrat**: Progress in offline reinforcement learning (RL) has been impeded by ambiguous problem definitions and entangled algorithmic designs, resulting in inconsistent implementations, insufficient ablations, and unfair evaluations. Although offline RL explicitly avoids environment interaction, prior methods frequently employ extensive, undocumented online evaluation for hyperparameter tuning, complicating method comparisons. Moreover, existing reference implementations differ significantly in boilerplate code, obscuring their core algorithmic contributions. We address these challenges by first introducing a rigorous taxonomy and a transparent evaluation protocol that explicitly quantifies online tuning budgets. To resolve opaque algorithmic design, we provide clean, minimalistic, single-file implementations of various model-free and model-based offline RL methods, significantly enhancing clarity and achieving substantial speed-ups. Leveraging these streamlined implementations, we propose Unifloral, a unified algorithm that encapsulates diverse prior approaches within a single, comprehensive hyperparameter space, enabling algorithm development in a shared hyperparameter space. Using Unifloral with our rigorous evaluation protocol, we develop two novel algorithms - TD3-AWR (model-free) and MoBRAC (model-based) - which substantially outperform established baselines. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/EmptyJackson/unifloral.





## Weight Ensembling Improves Reasoning in Language Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10478v2
- **Authors**: ['Xingyu Dang', 'Christina Baek', 'Kaiyue Wen', 'Zico Kolter', 'Aditi Raghunathan']
- **Abstrat**: We investigate a failure mode that arises during the training of reasoning models, where the diversity of generations begins to collapse, leading to suboptimal test-time scaling. Notably, the Pass@1 rate reliably improves during supervised finetuning (SFT), but Pass@k rapidly deteriorates. Surprisingly, a simple intervention of interpolating the weights of the latest SFT checkpoint with an early checkpoint, otherwise known as WiSE-FT, almost completely recovers Pass@k while also improving Pass@1. The WiSE-FT variant achieves better test-time scaling (Best@k, majority vote) and achieves superior results with less data when tuned further by reinforcement learning. Finally, we find that WiSE-FT provides complementary performance gains that cannot be achieved only through diversity-inducing decoding strategies, like temperature scaling. We formalize a bias-variance tradeoff of Pass@k with respect to the expectation and variance of Pass@1 over the test distribution. We find that WiSE-FT can reduce bias and variance simultaneously, while temperature scaling inherently trades-off between bias and variance.





## Embodied World Models Emerge from Navigational Task in Open-Ended Environments
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11419v1
- **Authors**: ['Li Jin', 'Liu Jia']
- **Abstrat**: Understanding how artificial systems can develop spatial awareness and reasoning has long been a challenge in AI research. Traditional models often rely on passive observation, but embodied cognition theory suggests that deeper understanding emerges from active interaction with the environment. This study investigates whether neural networks can autonomously internalize spatial concepts through interaction, focusing on planar navigation tasks. Using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) combined with Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), we show that agents can learn to encode spatial properties like direction, distance, and obstacle avoidance. We introduce Hybrid Dynamical Systems (HDS) to model the agent-environment interaction as a closed dynamical system, revealing stable limit cycles that correspond to optimal navigation strategies. Ridge Representation allows us to map navigation paths into a fixed-dimensional behavioral space, enabling comparison with neural states. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) confirms strong alignment between these representations, suggesting that the agent's neural states actively encode spatial knowledge. Intervention experiments further show that specific neural dimensions are causally linked to navigation performance. This work provides an approach to bridging the gap between action and perception in AI, offering new insights into building adaptive, interpretable models that can generalize across complex environments. The causal validation of neural representations also opens new avenues for understanding and controlling the internal mechanisms of AI systems, pushing the boundaries of how machines learn and reason in dynamic, real-world scenarios.





## Measures of Variability for Risk-averse Policy Gradient
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11412v1
- **Authors**: ['Yudong Luo', 'Yangchen Pan', 'Jiaqi Tan', 'Pascal Poupart']
- **Abstrat**: Risk-averse reinforcement learning (RARL) is critical for decision-making under uncertainty, which is especially valuable in high-stake applications. However, most existing works focus on risk measures, e.g., conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), while measures of variability remain underexplored. In this paper, we comprehensively study nine common measures of variability, namely Variance, Gini Deviation, Mean Deviation, Mean-Median Deviation, Standard Deviation, Inter-Quantile Range, CVaR Deviation, Semi_Variance, and Semi_Standard Deviation. Among them, four metrics have not been previously studied in RARL. We derive policy gradient formulas for these unstudied metrics, improve gradient estimation for Gini Deviation, analyze their gradient properties, and incorporate them with the REINFORCE and PPO frameworks to penalize the dispersion of returns.   Our empirical study reveals that variance-based metrics lead to unstable policy updates. In contrast, CVaR Deviation and Gini Deviation show consistent performance across different randomness and evaluation domains, achieving high returns while effectively learning risk-averse policies. Mean Deviation and Semi_Standard Deviation are also competitive across different scenarios. This work provides a comprehensive overview of variability measures in RARL, offering practical insights for risk-aware decision-making and guiding future research on risk metrics and RARL algorithms.

- **Abstrat**: We present Kimi-VL, an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model (VLM) that offers advanced multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities - all while activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B). Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and 34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common tasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant: Kimi-VL-Thinking. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), this model exhibits strong long-horizon reasoning capabilities. It achieves scores of 61.7 on MMMU, 36.8 on MathVision, and 71.3 on MathVista while maintaining the compact 2.8B activated LLM parameters, setting a new standard for efficient multimodal thinking models.

- **Abstrat**: We introduce Kimina-Prover Preview, a large language model that pioneers a novel reasoning-driven exploration paradigm for formal theorem proving, as showcased in this preview release. Trained with a large-scale reinforcement learning pipeline from Qwen2.5-72B, Kimina-Prover demonstrates strong performance in Lean 4 proof generation by employing a structured reasoning pattern we term \textit{formal reasoning pattern}. This approach allows the model to emulate human problem-solving strategies in Lean, iteratively generating and refining proof steps. Kimina-Prover sets a new state-of-the-art on the miniF2F benchmark, reaching 80.7% with pass@8192. Beyond improved benchmark performance, our work yields several key insights: (1) Kimina-Prover exhibits high sample efficiency, delivering strong results even with minimal sampling (pass@1) and scaling effectively with computational budget, stemming from its unique reasoning pattern and RL training; (2) we demonstrate clear performance scaling with model size, a trend previously unobserved for neural theorem provers in formal mathematics; (3) the learned reasoning style, distinct from traditional search algorithms, shows potential to bridge the gap between formal verification and informal mathematical intuition. We open source distilled versions with 1.5B and 7B parameters of Kimina-Prover





## A Minimalist Approach to LLM Reasoning: from Rejection Sampling to Reinforce

- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a prevailing approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training.





## Deep Learning Based Service Composition in Integrated Aerial-Terrestrial Networks
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07528v2
- **Authors**: ['Mohammad Farhoudi', 'Masoud Shokrnezhad', 'Somayeh Kianpisheh', 'Tarik Taleb']
- **Abstrat**: The explosive growth of user devices and emerging applications is driving unprecedented traffic demands, accompanied by stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Addressing these challenges necessitates innovative service orchestration methods capable of seamless integration across the edge-cloud continuum. Terrestrial network-based service orchestration methods struggle to deliver timely responses to growing traffic demands or support users with poor or lack of access to terrestrial infrastructure. Exploiting both aerial and terrestrial resources in service composition increases coverage and facilitates the use of full computing and communication potentials. This paper proposes a service placement and composition mechanism for integrated aerial-terrestrial networks over the edge-cloud continuum while considering the dynamic nature of the network. The service function placement and service orchestration are modeled in an optimization framework. Considering the dynamicity, the Aerial Base Station (ABS) trajectory might not be deterministic, and their mobility pattern might not be known as assumed knowledge. Also, service requests can traverse through access nodes due to users' mobility. By incorporating predictive algorithms, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches, the proposed method predicts ABS locations and service requests. Subsequently, a heuristic isomorphic graph matching approach is proposed to enable efficient, latency-aware service orchestration. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed prediction and service composition schemes in terms of accuracy, cost optimization, scalability, and responsiveness, ensuring timely and reliable service delivery under diverse network conditions.





## Think or Not Think: A Study of Explicit Thinking in Rule-Based Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16188v3
- **Authors**: ['Ming Li', 'Jike Zhong', 'Shitian Zhao', 'Yuxiang Lai', 'Kaipeng Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: This paper investigates the thinking process in rule-based reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RFT) for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). We first propose CLS-RL for classification, using verifiable rewards to encourage MLLM thinking. Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a 'free-lunch' generalization effect (improving performance on unseen datasets after training on one dataset). We then question if this explicit thinking is always necessary for RFT. Challenging convention that explicit thinking is crucial for RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, minimizing thinking via a simple equality accuracy reward. Experiments show No-Thinking-RL surpasses CLS-RL in in-domain and generalization abilities, with significantly less fine-tuning time. This suggests reducing thinking can improve MLLM fine-tuning efficiency and effectiveness for certain visual tasks. We hypothesize explicit thinking negatively impacts reward convergence during RFT. To test this, we propose the Think-After-Answerwer method to let models first output the answer and then generate thinking process to alliviate the negative impact of thinking. We further test No-Thinking-RL on diverse tasks (including math, spatial, puzzles) with 2B and 7B models. For 2B models, No-Thinking-RL outperforms thinking-based RFT for all tasks, even on math, with Think-After-Answerwer performing intermediately. For 7B models, performance is comparable on simple visual tasks, but RFT with thinking excels on complex reasoning (math). This implies when dealing with complex math problems, smaller models struggle with generating effective reasoning, hurting performance on complex tasks. Conversely, for simple visual tasks, thinking is not indispensable, and its removal can boost performance and reduce training time. We hope our findings offer insights for better understanding the effect of the thinking process in RFT.





## Enhancing Commentary Strategies for Imperfect Information Card Games: A Study of Large Language Models in Guandan Commentary

- **Authors**: ['Meiling Tao', 'Xuechen Liang', 'Xinyuan Song', 'Yangfan He', 'Yiling Tao', 'Jianhui Wang', 'Sun Li Tianyu Shi']
- **Abstrat**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked the potential for generating high-quality game commentary. However, producing insightful and engaging commentary for complex games with incomplete information remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel commentary method that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and LLMs, tailored specifically for the Chinese card game \textit{Guandan}. Our system leverages RL to generate intricate card-playing scenarios and employs LLMs to generate corresponding commentary text, effectively emulating the strategic analysis and narrative prowess of professional commentators. The framework comprises a state commentary guide, a Theory of Mind (ToM)-based strategy analyzer, and a style retrieval module, which seamlessly collaborate to deliver detailed and context-relevant game commentary in the Chinese language environment. We empower LLMs with ToM capabilities and refine both retrieval and information filtering mechanisms. This facilitates the generation of personalized commentary content. Our experimental results showcase the substantial enhancement in performance achieved by the proposed commentary framework when applied to open-source LLMs, surpassing the performance of GPT-4 across multiple evaluation metrics.





## Can Learned Optimization Make Reinforcement Learning Less Difficult?
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07082v3
- **Authors**: ['Alexander David Goldie', 'Chris Lu', 'Matthew Thomas Jackson', 'Shimon Whiteson', 'Jakob Nicolaus Foerster']
- **Abstrat**: While reinforcement learning (RL) holds great potential for decision making in the real world, it suffers from a number of unique difficulties which often need specific consideration. In particular: it is highly non-stationary; suffers from high degrees of plasticity loss; and requires exploration to prevent premature convergence to local optima and maximize return. In this paper, we consider whether learned optimization can help overcome these problems. Our method, Learned Optimization for Plasticity, Exploration and Non-stationarity (OPEN), meta-learns an update rule whose input features and output structure are informed by previously proposed solutions to these difficulties. We show that our parameterization is flexible enough to enable meta-learning in diverse learning contexts, including the ability to use stochasticity for exploration. Our experiments demonstrate that when meta-trained on single and small sets of environments, OPEN outperforms or equals traditionally used optimizers. Furthermore, OPEN shows strong generalization characteristics across a range of environments and agent architectures.





## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Greenhouse Gas Offset Credit Markets
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11258v1
- **Authors**: ['Liam Welsh', 'Udit Grover', 'Sebastian Jaimungal']
- **Abstrat**: Climate change is a major threat to the future of humanity, and its impacts are being intensified by excess man-made greenhouse gas emissions. One method governments can employ to control these emissions is to provide firms with emission limits and penalize any excess emissions above the limit. Excess emissions may also be offset by firms who choose to invest in carbon reducing and capturing projects. These projects generate offset credits which can be submitted to a regulating agency to offset a firm's excess emissions, or they can be traded with other firms. In this work, we characterize the finite-agent Nash equilibrium for offset credit markets. As computing Nash equilibria is an NP-hard problem, we utilize the modern reinforcement learning technique Nash-DQN to efficiently estimate the market's Nash equilibria. We demonstrate not only the validity of employing reinforcement learning methods applied to climate themed financial markets, but also the significant financial savings emitting firms may achieve when abiding by the Nash equilibria through numerical experiments.





## A Rollout-Based Algorithm and Reward Function for Efficient Resource Allocation in Business Processes
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11250v1
- **Authors**: ['Jeroen Middelhuis', 'Zaharah Bukhsh', 'Ivo Adan', 'Remco Dijkman']
- **Abstrat**: Resource allocation plays a critical role in minimizing cycle time and improving the efficiency of business processes. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool to optimize resource allocation policies in business processes. In the DRL framework, an agent learns a policy through interaction with the environment, guided solely by reward signals that indicate the quality of its decisions. However, existing algorithms are not suitable for dynamic environments such as business processes. Furthermore, existing DRL-based methods rely on engineered reward functions that approximate the desired objective, but a misalignment between reward and objective can lead to undesired decisions or suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose a rollout-based DRL algorithm and a reward function to optimize the objective directly. Our algorithm iteratively improves the policy by evaluating execution trajectories following different actions. Our reward function directly decomposes the objective function of minimizing the mean cycle time. Maximizing our reward function guarantees that the objective function is minimized without requiring extensive reward engineering. The results show that our method consistently learns the optimal policy in all six evaluated business processes, outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithm that can only learn the optimal policy in two of the evaluated processes.





## Next-Future: Sample-Efficient Policy Learning for Robotic-Arm Tasks
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11247v1
- **Authors**: ['Fikrican Özgür', 'René Zurbrügg', 'Suryansh Kumar']
- **Abstrat**: Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) is widely regarded as the state-of-the-art algorithm for achieving sample-efficient multi-goal reinforcement learning (RL) in robotic manipulation tasks with binary rewards. HER facilitates learning from failed attempts by replaying trajectories with redefined goals. However, it relies on a heuristic-based replay method that lacks a principled framework. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel replay strategy, "Next-Future", which focuses on rewarding single-step transitions. This approach significantly enhances sample efficiency and accuracy in learning multi-goal Markov decision processes (MDPs), particularly under stringent accuracy requirements -- a critical aspect for performing complex and precise robotic-arm tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by highlighting how single-step learning enables improved value approximation within the multi-goal RL framework. The performance of the proposed replay strategy is evaluated across eight challenging robotic manipulation tasks, using ten random seeds for training. Our results indicate substantial improvements in sample efficiency for seven out of eight tasks and higher success rates in six tasks. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the practical feasibility of the learned policies, demonstrating the potential of "Next-Future" in solving complex robotic-arm tasks.





## GUI-R1 : A Generalist R1-Style Vision-Language Action Model For GUI Agents
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10458v2
- **Authors**: ['Xiaobo Xia', 'Run Luo']
- **Abstrat**: Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.





## MM-Eureka: Exploring the Frontiers of Multimodal Reasoning with Rule-based Reinforcement Learning

- **Abstrat**: DeepSeek R1, and o1 have demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities in the text domain through stable large-scale reinforcement learning. To enable broader applications, some works have attempted to transfer these capabilities to multimodal reasoning. However, these efforts have been limited by the limited difficulty of selected tasks and relatively small training scales, making it challenging to demonstrate strong multimodal reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMK12 dataset and MM-EUREKA with 7B and 32B parameters. The former is a high-quality multimodal mathematics reasoning dataset featuring diverse knowledge domains with human-verified answers and solution processes. The latter is a multimodal model employing rule-based reinforcement learning on MMK12, utilizing online filtering and two-stage training strategy to enhance training stability. MM-EUREKA demonstrates remarkable performance gains in multimodal mathematical reasoning, outperforming previous powerful models like InternVL2.5-78B or InternVL2.5-38B-MPO. In particular, MM-EUREKA achieves competitive or superior performance compared to both open-source and closed-source models, and trails slightly behind o1 in multidisciplinary reasoning tasks. We open-source our complete pipeline to foster further research in this area. We release all our codes, models, data, etc. at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA





## PIP-Loco: A Proprioceptive Infinite Horizon Planning Framework for Quadrupedal Robot Locomotion
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09441v3
- **Authors**: ['Aditya Shirwatkar', 'Naman Saxena', 'Kishore Chandra', 'Shishir Kolathaya']
- **Abstrat**: A core strength of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for quadrupedal locomotion has been its ability to enforce constraints and provide interpretability of the sequence of commands over the horizon. However, despite being able to plan, MPC struggles to scale with task complexity, often failing to achieve robust behavior on rapidly changing surfaces. On the other hand, model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have outperformed MPC on multiple terrains, showing emergent motions but inherently lack any ability to handle constraints or perform planning. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that integrates proprioceptive planning with RL, allowing for agile and safe locomotion behaviors through the horizon. Inspired by MPC, we incorporate an internal model that includes a velocity estimator and a Dreamer module. During training, the framework learns an expert policy and an internal model that are co-dependent, facilitating exploration for improved locomotion behaviors. During deployment, the Dreamer module solves an infinite-horizon MPC problem, adapting actions and velocity commands to respect the constraints. We validate the robustness of our training framework through ablation studies on internal model components and demonstrate improved robustness to training noise. Finally, we evaluate our approach across multi-terrain scenarios in both simulation and hardware.





## Breaking the Pre-Planning Barrier: Adaptive Real-Time Coordination of Heterogeneous UAVs
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14488v2
- **Authors**: ['Yuhan Hu', 'Yirong Sun', 'Yanjun Chen', 'Xinghao Chen', 'Xiaoyu Shen', 'Wei Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer significant potential in dynamic, perception-intensive tasks such as search and rescue and environmental monitoring; however, their effectiveness is severely restricted by conventional pre-planned routing methods, which lack the flexibility to respond in real-time to evolving task demands, unexpected disturbances, and localized view limitations in real-world scenarios. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework named \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{G}raph \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{M}ulti-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (HGAM), uniquely designed to enable adaptive real-time coordination between mission UAVs (MUAVs) and charging UAVs (CUAVs). HGAM specifically addresses the previously unsolved challenge of enabling precise, decentralized continuous-action coordination solely based on local, heterogeneous graph-based observations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HGAM substantially surpasses existing methods, achieving, for example, a 30\% improvement in data collection coverage and a 20\% increase in charging efficiency, providing crucial insights and foundations for the future deployment of intelligent, flexible UAV networks in complex, dynamic environments.





## Revealing Covert Attention by Analyzing Human and Reinforcement Learning Agent Gameplay
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11118v1
- **Authors**: ['Henrik Krauss', 'Takehisa Yairi']
- **Abstrat**: This study introduces a novel method for revealing human covert attention patterns using gameplay data alone, utilizing offline attention techniques from reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the contextualized, task-relevant (CTR) attention network, which generates attention maps from both human and RL agent gameplay in Atari environments. These maps are sparse yet retain the necessary information for the current player's decision making. We compare the CTR-derived attention maps with a temporally integrated overt attention (TIOA) model based on eye-tracking data, serving as a point of comparison and discussion. Visual inspection reveals distinct attention patterns: human CTR maps focus on the player and rather nearby opponents, occasionally shifting between stronger focus and broader views - sometimes even attending to empty space ahead. In contrast, agent maps maintain a consistent broad focus on most objects, including distant ones and the player. Quantitative analysis further demonstrates that human CTR maps align more closely with TIOA than agent maps do. Our findings indicate that the CTR attention network can effectively reveal human covert attention patterns from gameplay alone, without the need for additional data like brain activity recordings. This work contributes to understanding human-agent attention differences and enables the development of RL agents augmented with human covert attention.

## A Clean Slate for Offline Reinforcement Learning

- **Authors**: ['Matthew Thomas Jackson', 'Uljad Berdica', 'Jarek Liesen', 'Shimon Whiteson', 'Jakob Nicolaus Foerster']
- **Abstrat**: Progress in offline reinforcement learning (RL) has been impeded by ambiguous problem definitions and entangled algorithmic designs, resulting in inconsistent implementations, insufficient ablations, and unfair evaluations. Although offline RL explicitly avoids environment interaction, prior methods frequently employ extensive, undocumented online evaluation for hyperparameter tuning, complicating method comparisons.

We address these challenges by first introducing a rigorous taxonomy and a transparent evaluation protocol that explicitly quantifies online tuning budgets. To resolve opaque algorithmic design, we provide clean, minimalistic, single-file implementations of various model-free and model-based offline RL methods, significantly enhancing clarity and achieving substantial speed-ups. Leveraging these streamlined implementations, we propose Unifloral, a unified algorithm that encapsulates diverse prior approaches within a single, comprehensive hyperparameter space, enabling algorithm development in a shared hyperparameter space. Using Unifloral with our rigorous evaluation protocol, we develop two novel algorithms - TD3-AWR (model-free) and MoBRAC (model-based) - which substantially outperform established baselines. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/EmptyJackson/unifloral.

## HAS-RRT: RRT-based Motion Planning using Topological Guidance
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10801v3
- **Authors**: ['Diane Uwacu', 'Ananya Yammanuru', 'Keerthana Nallamotu', 'Vasu Chalasani', 'Marco Morales', 'Nancy M. Amato']
- **Abstrat**: We present a hierarchical RRT-based motion planning strategy, Hierarchical Annotated-Skeleton Guided RRT (HAS-RRT), guided by a workspace skeleton, to solve motion planning problems. HAS-RRT provides up to a 91% runtime reduction and builds a tree at least 30% smaller than competitors while still finding competitive-cost paths. This is because our strategy prioritizes paths indicated by the workspace guidance to efficiently find a valid motion plan for the robot. Existing methods either rely too heavily on workspace guidance or have difficulty finding narrow passages. By taking advantage of the assumptions that the workspace skeleton provides, HAS-RRT is able to build a smaller tree and find a path faster than its competitors. Additionally, we show that HAS-RRT is robust to the quality of workspace guidance provided and that, in a worst-case scenario where the workspace skeleton provides no additional insight, our method performs comparably to an unguided method.





## FreeDOM: Online Dynamic Object Removal Framework for Static Map Construction Based on Conservative Free Space Estimation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11073v1
- **Authors**: ['Chen Li', 'Wanlei Li', 'Wenhao Liu', 'Yixiang Shu', 'Yunjiang Lou']
- **Abstrat**: Online map construction is essential for autonomous robots to navigate in unknown environments. However, the presence of dynamic objects may introduce artifacts into the map, which can significantly degrade the performance of localization and path planning. To tackle this problem, a novel online dynamic object removal framework for static map construction based on conservative free space estimation (FreeDOM) is proposed, consisting of a scan-removal front-end and a map-refinement back-end. First, we propose a multi-resolution map structure for fast computation and effective map representation. In the scan-removal front-end, we employ raycast enhancement to improve free space estimation and segment the LiDAR scan based on the estimated free space. In the map-refinement back-end, we further eliminate residual dynamic objects in the map by leveraging incremental free space information. As experimentally verified on SemanticKITTI, HeLiMOS, and indoor datasets with various sensors, our proposed framework overcomes the limitations of visibility-based methods and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an average F1-score improvement of 9.7%.
