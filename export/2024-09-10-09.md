- **Abstrat**: Recent advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked considerable interest in the integration of these two cutting-edge fields. Among the various ML techniques, reinforcement learning (RL) stands out for its ability to address complex sequential decision-making problems. RL has already demonstrated substantial success in the classical ML community. Now, the emerging field of Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) seeks to enhance RL algorithms by incorporating principles from quantum computing. This paper offers an introduction to this exciting area for the broader AI and ML community.

- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09237v4
- **Authors**: ['Alex Sanchez-Stern', 'Abhishek Varghese', 'Zhanna Kaufman', 'Dylan Zhang', 'Talia Ringer', 'Yuriy Brun']
- **Abstrat**: Formal verification is a promising method for producing reliable software, but the difficulty of manually writing verification proofs severely limits its utility in practice. Recent methods have automated some proof synthesis by guiding a search through the proof space using a theorem prover. Unfortunately, the theorem prover provides only the crudest estimate of progress, resulting in effectively undirected search. To address this problem, we create QEDCartographer, an automated proof-synthesis tool that combines supervised and reinforcement learning to more effectively explore the proof space. QEDCartographer incorporates the proofs' branching structure, enabling reward-free search and overcoming the sparse reward problem inherent to formal verification. We evaluate QEDCartographer using the CoqGym benchmark of 68.5K theorems from 124 open-source Coq projects. QEDCartographer fully automatically proves 21.4% of the test-set theorems. Previous search-based proof-synthesis tools Tok, Tac, ASTactic, Passport, and Proverbot9001, which rely only on supervised learning, prove 9.6%, 9.8%, 10.9%, 12.5%, and 19.8%, respectively. Diva, which combines 62 tools, proves 19.2%. Comparing to the most effective prior tool, Proverbot9001, QEDCartographer produces 34% shorter proofs 29% faster, on average over the theorems both tools prove. Together, QEDCartographer and non-learning-based CoqHammer prove 30.3% of the theorems, while CoqHammer alone proves 26.6%. Our work demonstrates that reinforcement learning is a fruitful research direction for improving proof-synthesis tools' search mechanisms.





## Markov Chain Variance Estimation: A Stochastic Approximation Approach
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05733v1
- **Authors**: ['Shubhada Agrawal', 'Prashanth L. A.', 'Siva Theja Maguluri']
- **Abstrat**: We consider the problem of estimating the asymptotic variance of a function defined on a Markov chain, an important step for statistical inference of the stationary mean. We design the first recursive estimator that requires $O(1)$ computation at each step, does not require storing any historical samples or any prior knowledge of run-length, and has optimal $O(\frac{1}{n})$ rate of convergence for the mean-squared error (MSE) with provable finite sample guarantees. Here, $n$ refers to the total number of samples generated. The previously best-known rate of convergence in MSE was $O(\frac{\log n}{n})$, achieved by jackknifed estimators, which also do not enjoy these other desirable properties. Our estimator is based on linear stochastic approximation of an equivalent formulation of the asymptotic variance in terms of the solution of the Poisson equation.   We generalize our estimator in several directions, including estimating the covariance matrix for vector-valued functions, estimating the stationary variance of a Markov chain, and approximately estimating the asymptotic variance in settings where the state space of the underlying Markov chain is large. We also show applications of our estimator in average reward reinforcement learning (RL), where we work with asymptotic variance as a risk measure to model safety-critical applications. We design a temporal-difference type algorithm tailored for policy evaluation in this context. We consider both the tabular and linear function approximation settings. Our work paves the way for developing actor-critic style algorithms for variance-constrained RL.





## Geometric Structure and Polynomial-time Algorithm of Game Equilibriums
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00747v4
- **Authors**: ['Hongbo Sun', 'Chongkun Xia', 'Junbo Tan', 'Bo Yuan', 'Xueqian Wang', 'Bin Liang']
- **Abstrat**: Whether a PTAS (polynomial-time approximation scheme) exists for game equilibriums has been an open question, and the absence of this polynomial-time algorithm has indications and consequences in three fields, such as the practicality of methods in algorithmic game theory, non-stationarity and curse of multiagency in MARL (multi-agent reinforcement learning), and the tractability of PPAD in computational complexity theory. In this paper, we introduce a geometric object called equilibrium bundle, which leads to a fundamental leap in the understanding of game equilibriums. Regarding the equilibrium bundle, first, we formalize perfect equilibriums of dynamic games as the zero points of its canonical section, second, we formalize a hybrid iteration of dynamic programming and interior point method as a line search on it, such that the method is an FPTAS (fully PTAS) for any perfect equilibrium of any dynamic game, implying PPAD=FP, third, we give the existence and oddness theorems of it as an extension of those of Nash equilibriums. As intermediate results, we introduce a concept called policy cone to give the sufficient and necessary condition for dynamic programming to converge to perfect equilibriums, and introduce two concepts called unbiased barrier problem and unbiased KKT conditions to make the interior point method to approximate Nash equilibriums. In experiment, the line search process is animated, and the method is tested on 2000 randomly generated dynamic games where it converges to a perfect equilibrium in every single case.





## Cooperative Decision-Making for CAVs at Unsignalized Intersections: A MARL Approach with Attention and Hierarchical Game Priors
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05712v1
- **Authors**: ['Jiaqi Liu', 'Peng Hang', 'Xiaoxiang Na', 'Chao Huang', 'Jian Sun']
- **Abstrat**: The development of autonomous vehicles has shown great potential to enhance the efficiency and safety of transportation systems. However, the decision-making issue in complex human-machine mixed traffic scenarios, such as unsignalized intersections, remains a challenge for autonomous vehicles. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to solve complex decision-making problems, existing RL methods still have limitations in dealing with cooperative decision-making of multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), ensuring safety during exploration, and simulating realistic human driver behaviors. In this paper, a novel and efficient algorithm, Multi-Agent Game-prior Attention Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MA-GA-DDPG), is proposed to address these limitations. Our proposed algorithm formulates the decision-making problem of CAVs at unsignalized intersections as a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and incorporates an attention mechanism to capture interaction dependencies between ego CAV and other agents. The attention weights between the ego vehicle and other agents are then used to screen interaction objects and obtain prior hierarchical game relations, based on which a safety inspector module is designed to improve the traffic safety. Furthermore, both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments were conducted, demonstrating that our method outperforms other baseline approaches in terms of driving safety, efficiency, and comfort.





## Forward KL Regularized Preference Optimization for Aligning Diffusion Policies
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05622v1
- **Authors**: ['Zhao Shan', 'Chenyou Fan', 'Shuang Qiu', 'Jiyuan Shi', 'Chenjia Bai']
- **Abstrat**: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in sequential decision-making by leveraging the highly expressive model capabilities in policy learning. A central problem for learning diffusion policies is to align the policy output with human intents in various tasks. To achieve this, previous methods conduct return-conditioned policy generation or Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based policy optimization, while they both rely on pre-defined reward functions. In this work, we propose a novel framework, Forward KL regularized Preference optimization for aligning Diffusion policies, to align the diffusion policy with preferences directly. We first train a diffusion policy from the offline dataset without considering the preference, and then align the policy to the preference data via direct preference optimization. During the alignment phase, we formulate direct preference learning in a diffusion policy, where the forward KL regularization is employed in preference optimization to avoid generating out-of-distribution actions. We conduct extensive experiments for MetaWorld manipulation and D4RL tasks. The results show our method exhibits superior alignment with preferences and outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms.





## RGBManip: Monocular Image-based Robotic Manipulation through Active Object Pose Estimation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03478v2
- **Authors**: ['Boshi An', 'Yiran Geng', 'Kai Chen', 'Xiaoqi Li', 'Qi Dou', 'Hao Dong']
- **Abstrat**: Robotic manipulation requires accurate perception of the environment, which poses a significant challenge due to its inherent complexity and constantly changing nature. In this context, RGB image and point-cloud observations are two commonly used modalities in visual-based robotic manipulation, but each of these modalities have their own limitations. Commercial point-cloud observations often suffer from issues like sparse sampling and noisy output due to the limits of the emission-reception imaging principle. On the other hand, RGB images, while rich in texture information, lack essential depth and 3D information crucial for robotic manipulation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an image-only robotic manipulation framework that leverages an eye-on-hand monocular camera installed on the robot's parallel gripper. By moving with the robot gripper, this camera gains the ability to actively perceive object from multiple perspectives during the manipulation process. This enables the estimation of 6D object poses, which can be utilized for manipulation. While, obtaining images from more and diverse viewpoints typically improves pose estimation, it also increases the manipulation time. To address this trade-off, we employ a reinforcement learning policy to synchronize the manipulation strategy with active perception, achieving a balance between 6D pose accuracy and manipulation efficiency. Our experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments showcase the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach. %, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve robust real-world robotic manipulation through active pose estimation. We believe that our method will inspire further research on real-world-oriented robotic manipulation.

- **Authors**: ["Giuseppe L'Erario", 'Drew Hanover', 'Angel Romero', 'Yunlong Song', 'Gabriele Nava', 'Paolo Maria Viceconte', 'Daniele Pucci', 'Davide Scaramuzza']
- **Abstrat**: Robot multimodal locomotion encompasses the ability to transition between walking and flying, representing a significant challenge in robotics. This work presents an approach that enables automatic smooth transitions between legged and aerial locomotion. Leveraging the concept of Adversarial Motion Priors, our method allows the robot to imitate motion datasets and accomplish the desired task without the need for complex reward functions. The robot learns walking patterns from human-like gaits and aerial locomotion patterns from motions obtained using trajectory optimization. Through this process, the robot adapts the locomotion scheme based on environmental feedback using reinforcement learning, with the spontaneous emergence of mode-switching behavior. The results highlight the potential for achieving multimodal locomotion in aerial humanoid robotics through automatic control of walking and flying modes, paving the way for applications in diverse domains such as search and rescue, surveillance, and exploration missions. This research contributes to advancing the capabilities of aerial humanoid robots in terms of versatile locomotion in various environments.





## Communication and Control Co-Design in 6G: Sequential Decision-Making with LLMs

- **Authors**: ['Xianfu Chen', 'Celimuge Wu', 'Yi Shen', 'Yusheng Ji', 'Tsutomu Yoshinaga', 'Qiang Ni', 'Charilaos C. Zarakovitis', 'Honggang Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: This article investigates a control system within the context of six-generation wireless networks. The control performance optimization confronts the technical challenges that arise from the intricate interactions between communication and control sub-systems, asking for a co-design. Accounting for the system dynamics, we formulate the sequential co-design decision-makings of communication and control over the discrete time horizon as a Markov decision process, for which a practical offline learning framework is proposed. Our proposed framework integrates large language models into the elements of reinforcement learning. We present a case study on the age of semantics-aware communication and control co-design to showcase the potentials from our proposed learning framework. Furthermore, we discuss the open issues remaining to make our proposed offline learning framework feasible for real-world implementations, and highlight the research directions for future explorations.

- **Abstrat**: We present VisFly, a quadrotor simulator designed to efficiently train vision-based flight policies using reinforcement learning algorithms. VisFly offers a user-friendly framework and interfaces, leveraging Habitat-Sim's rendering engines to achieve frame rates exceeding 10,000 frames per second for rendering motion and sensor data. The simulator incorporates differentiable physics and is seamlessly wrapped with the Gym environment, facilitating the straightforward implementation of various learning algorithms. It supports the directly importing open-source scene datasets compatible with Habitat-Sim, enabling training on diverse real-world environments simultaneously. To validate our simulator, we also make three reinforcement learning examples for typical flight tasks relying on visual observations. The simulator is now available at [https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS-team/VisFly].





## Explaining Learned Reward Functions with Counterfactual Trajectories
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04856v2
- **Authors**: ['Jan Wehner', 'Frans Oliehoek', 'Luciano Cavalcante Siebert']
- **Abstrat**: Learning rewards from human behaviour or feedback is a promising approach to aligning AI systems with human values but fails to consistently extract correct reward functions. Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.





## Adaptive Multi-Layer Deployment for A Digital Twin Empowered Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Network
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05480v1
- **Authors**: ['Yihong Tao', 'Bo Lei', 'Haoyang Shi', 'Jingkai Chen', 'Xing Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: With the development of satellite communication technology, satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STIN), which integrate satellite networks and ground networks, can realize seamless global coverage of communication services. Confronting the intricacies of network dynamics, the diversity of resource heterogeneity, and the unpredictability of user mobility, dynamic resource allocation within networks faces formidable challenges. Digital twin (DT), as a new technique, can reflect a physical network to a virtual network to monitor, analyze, and optimize the physical network. Nevertheless, in the process of constructing the DT model, the deployment location and resource allocation of DTs may adversely affect its performance. Therefore, we propose a STIN model, which alleviates the problem of insufficient single-layer deployment flexibility of the traditional edge network by deploying DTs in multi-layer nodes in a STIN. To address the challenge of deploying DTs in the network, we propose multi-layer DT deployment in a STIN to reduce system delay. Then we adopt a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scheme to explore the optimal strategy of the DT multi-layer deployment problem. The implemented scheme demonstrates a notable reduction in system delay, as evidenced by simulation outcomes.





## Reinforcement Learning for Variational Quantum Circuits Design
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05475v1
- **Authors**: ['Simone Foder√†', 'Gloria Turati', 'Riccardo Nembrini', 'Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema', 'Paolo Cremonesi']
- **Abstrat**: Variational Quantum Algorithms have emerged as promising tools for solving optimization problems on quantum computers. These algorithms leverage a parametric quantum circuit called ansatz, where its parameters are adjusted by a classical optimizer with the goal of optimizing a certain cost function. However, a significant challenge lies in designing effective circuits for addressing specific problems. In this study, we leverage the powerful and flexible Reinforcement Learning paradigm to train an agent capable of autonomously generating quantum circuits that can be used as ansatzes in variational algorithms to solve optimization problems. The agent is trained on diverse problem instances, including Maximum Cut, Maximum Clique and Minimum Vertex Cover, built from different graph topologies and sizes. Our analysis of the circuits generated by the agent and the corresponding solutions shows that the proposed method is able to generate effective ansatzes. While our goal is not to propose any new specific ansatz, we observe how the agent has discovered a novel family of ansatzes effective for Maximum Cut problems, which we call $R_{yz}$-connected. We study the characteristics of one of these ansatzes by comparing it against state-of-the-art quantum algorithms across instances of varying graph topologies, sizes, and problem types. Our results indicate that the $R_{yz}$-connected circuit achieves high approximation ratios for Maximum Cut problems, further validating our proposed agent. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of Reinforcement Learning techniques in assisting researchers to design effective quantum circuits which could have applications in a wide number of tasks.





## Semifactual Explanations for Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05435v1
- **Authors**: ['Jasmina Gajcin', 'Jovan Jeromela', 'Ivana Dusparic']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a learning paradigm in which the agent learns from its environment through trial and error. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms represent the agent's policies using neural networks, making their decisions difficult to interpret. Explaining the behaviour of DRL agents is necessary to advance user trust, increase engagement, and facilitate integration with real-life tasks. Semifactual explanations aim to explain an outcome by providing "even if" scenarios, such as "even if the car were moving twice as slowly, it would still have to swerve to avoid crashing". Semifactuals help users understand the effects of different factors on the outcome and support the optimisation of resources. While extensively studied in psychology and even utilised in supervised learning, semifactuals have not been used to explain the decisions of RL systems. In this work, we develop a first approach to generating semifactual explanations for RL agents. We start by defining five properties of desirable semifactual explanations in RL and then introducing SGRL-Rewind and SGRL-Advance, the first algorithms for generating semifactual explanations in RL. We evaluate the algorithms in two standard RL environments and find that they generate semifactuals that are easier to reach, represent the agent's policy better, and are more diverse compared to baselines. Lastly, we conduct and analyse a user study to assess the participant's perception of semifactual explanations of the agent's actions.





## State-Novelty Guided Action Persistence in Deep Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05433v1
- **Authors**: ['Jianshu Hu', 'Paul Weng', 'Yutong Ban']
- **Abstrat**: While a powerful and promising approach, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) still suffers from sample inefficiency, which can be notably improved by resorting to more sophisticated techniques to address the exploration-exploitation dilemma. One such technique relies on action persistence (i.e., repeating an action over multiple steps). However, previous work exploiting action persistence either applies a fixed strategy or learns additional value functions (or policy) for selecting the repetition number. In this paper, we propose a novel method to dynamically adjust the action persistence based on the current exploration status of the state space. In such a way, our method does not require training of additional value functions or policy. Moreover, the use of a smooth scheduling of the repeat probability allows a more effective balance between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into various basic exploration strategies to incorporate temporal persistence. Finally, extensive experiments on different DMControl tasks demonstrate that our state-novelty guided action persistence method significantly improves the sample efficiency.





## Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traveling Purchaser Problems
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02476v4
- **Authors**: ['Haofeng Yuan', 'Rongping Zhu', 'Wanlu Yang', 'Shiji Song', 'Keyou You', 'Wei Fan', 'C. L. Philip Chen']
- **Abstrat**: The traveling purchaser problem (TPP) is an important combinatorial optimization problem with broad applications. Due to the coupling between routing and purchasing, existing works on TPPs commonly address route construction and purchase planning simultaneously, which, however, leads to exact methods with high computational cost and heuristics with sophisticated design but limited performance. In sharp contrast, we propose a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which addresses route construction and purchase planning separately, while evaluating and optimizing the solution from a global perspective. The key components of our approach include a bipartite graph representation for TPPs to capture the market-product relations, and a policy network that extracts information from the bipartite graph and uses it to sequentially construct the route. One significant benefit of our framework is that we can efficiently construct the route using the policy network, and once the route is determined, the associated purchasing plan can be easily derived through linear programming, while, leveraging DRL, we can train the policy network to optimize the global solution objective. Furthermore, by introducing a meta-learning strategy, the policy network can be trained stably on large-sized TPP instances, and generalize well across instances of varying sizes and distributions, even to much larger instances that are never seen during training. Experiments on various synthetic TPP instances and the TPPLIB benchmark demonstrate that our DRL-based approach can significantly outperform well-established TPP heuristics, reducing the optimality gap by 40%-90%, and also showing an advantage in runtime, especially on large-sized instances.





## Reinforcement Unlearning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15910v5
- **Authors**: ['Dayong Ye', 'Tianqing Zhu', 'Congcong Zhu', 'Derui Wang', 'Kun Gao', 'Zewei Shi', 'Sheng Shen', 'Wanlei Zhou', 'Minhui Xue']
- **Abstrat**: Machine unlearning refers to the process of mitigating the influence of specific training data on machine learning models based on removal requests from data owners. However, one important area that has been largely overlooked in the research of unlearning is reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning focuses on training an agent to make optimal decisions within an environment to maximize its cumulative rewards. During the training, the agent tends to memorize the features of the environment, which raises a significant concern about privacy. As per data protection regulations, the owner of the environment holds the right to revoke access to the agent's training data, thus necessitating the development of a novel and pressing research field, known as \emph{reinforcement unlearning}. Reinforcement unlearning focuses on revoking entire environments rather than individual data samples. This unique characteristic presents three distinct challenges: 1) how to propose unlearning schemes for environments; 2) how to avoid degrading the agent's performance in remaining environments; and 3) how to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning. To tackle these challenges, we propose two reinforcement unlearning methods. The first method is based on decremental reinforcement learning, which aims to erase the agent's previously acquired knowledge gradually. The second method leverages environment poisoning attacks, which encourage the agent to learn new, albeit incorrect, knowledge to remove the unlearning environment. Particularly, to tackle the third challenge, we introduce the concept of ``environment inference attack'' to evaluate the unlearning outcomes.

## Neural MP: A Generalist Neural Motion Planner

- **Authors**: ['Murtaza Dalal', 'Jiahui Yang', 'Russell Mendonca', 'Youssef Khaky', 'Ruslan Salakhutdinov', 'Deepak Pathak']
- **Abstrat**: The current paradigm for motion planning generates solutions from scratch for every new problem, which consumes significant amounts of time and computational resources. For complex, cluttered scenes, motion planning approaches can often take minutes to produce a solution, while humans are able to accurately and safely reach any goal in seconds by leveraging their prior experience. We seek to do the same by applying data-driven learning at scale to the problem of motion planning. Our approach builds a large number of complex scenes in simulation, collects expert data from a motion planner, then distills it into a reactive generalist policy. We then combine this with lightweight optimization to obtain a safe path for real world deployment. We perform a thorough evaluation of our method on 64 motion planning tasks across four diverse environments with randomized poses, scenes and obstacles, in the real world, demonstrating an improvement of 23%, 17% and 79% motion planning success rate over state of the art sampling, optimization and learning based planning methods.

## StratXplore: Strategic Novelty-seeking and Instruction-aligned Exploration for Vision and Language Navigation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05593v1
- **Authors**: ['Muraleekrishna Gopinathan', 'Jumana Abu-Khalaf', 'David Suter', 'Martin Masek']
- **Abstrat**: Embodied navigation requires robots to understand and interact with the environment based on given tasks. Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is an embodied navigation task, where a robot navigates within a previously seen and unseen environment, based on linguistic instruction and visual inputs. VLN agents need access to both local and global action spaces; former for immediate decision making and the latter for recovering from navigational mistakes. Prior VLN agents rely only on instruction-viewpoint alignment for local and global decision making and back-track to a previously visited viewpoint, if the instruction and its current viewpoint mismatches. These methods are prone to mistakes, due to the complexity of the instruction and partial observability of the environment. We posit that, back-tracking is sub-optimal and agent that is aware of its mistakes can recover efficiently. For optimal recovery, exploration should be extended to unexplored viewpoints (or frontiers). The optimal frontier is a recently observed but unexplored viewpoint that aligns with the instruction and is novel. We introduce a memory-based and mistake-aware path planning strategy for VLN agents, called \textit{StratXplore}, that presents global and local action planning to select the optimal frontier for path correction. The proposed method collects all past actions and viewpoint features during navigation and then selects the optimal frontier suitable for recovery. Experimental results show this simple yet effective strategy improves the success rate on two VLN datasets with different task complexities.





## Adaptive Probabilistic Planning for the Uncertain and Dynamic Orienteering Problem
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05545v1
- **Authors**: ['Qiuchen Qian', 'Yanran Wang', 'David Boyle']
- **Abstrat**: The Orienteering Problem (OP) is a well-studied routing problem that has been extended to incorporate uncertainties, reflecting stochastic or dynamic travel costs, prize-collection costs, and prizes. Existing approaches may, however, be inefficient in real-world applications due to insufficient modeling knowledge and initially unknowable parameters in online scenarios. Thus, we propose the Uncertain and Dynamic Orienteering Problem (UDOP), modeling travel costs as distributions with unknown and time-variant parameters. UDOP also associates uncertain travel costs with dynamic prizes and prize-collection costs for its objective and budget constraints. To address UDOP, we develop an ADaptive Approach for Probabilistic paThs - ADAPT, that iteratively performs 'execution' and 'online planning' based on an initial 'offline' solution. The execution phase updates system status and records online cost observations. The online planner employs a Bayesian approach to adaptively estimate power consumption and optimize path sequence based on safety beliefs. We evaluate ADAPT in a practical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) charging scheduling problem for Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks. The UAV must optimize its path to recharge sensor nodes efficiently while managing its energy under uncertain conditions. ADAPT maintains comparable solution quality and computation time while offering superior robustness. Extensive simulations show that ADAPT achieves a 100% Mission Success Rate (MSR) across all tested scenarios, outperforming comparable heuristic-based and frequentist approaches that fail up to 70% (under challenging conditions) and averaging 67% MSR, respectively. This work advances the field of OP with uncertainties, offering a reliable and efficient approach for real-world applications in uncertain and dynamic environments.





## DWA-3D: A Reactive Planner for Robust and Efficient Autonomous UAV Navigation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05421v1
- **Authors**: ['Jorge Bes', 'Juan Dendarieta', 'Luis Riazuelo', 'Luis Montano']
- **Abstrat**: Despite the growing impact of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) across various industries, most of current available solutions lack for a robust autonomous navigation system to deal with the appearance of obstacles safely. This work presents an approach to perform autonomous UAV planning and navigation in scenarios in which a safe and high maneuverability is required, due to the cluttered environment and the narrow rooms to move. The system combines an RRT* global planner with a newly proposed reactive planner, DWA-3D, which is the extension of the well known DWA method for 2D robots. We provide a theoretical-empirical method for adjusting the parameters of the objective function to optimize, easing the classical difficulty for tuning them. An onboard LiDAR provides a 3D point cloud, which is projected on an Octomap in which the planning and navigation decisions are made. There is not a prior map; the system builds and updates the map online, from the current and the past LiDAR information included in the Octomap. Extensive real-world experiments were conducted to validate the system and to obtain a fine tuning of the involved parameters. These experiments allowed us to provide a set of values that ensure safe operation across all the tested scenarios. Just by weighting two parameters, it is possible to prioritize either horizontal path alignment or vertical (height) tracking, resulting in enhancing vertical or lateral avoidance, respectively. Additionally, our DWA-3D proposal is able to navigate successfully even in absence of a global planner or with one that does not consider the drone's size. Finally, the conducted experiments show that computation time with the proposed parameters is not only bounded but also remains stable around 40 ms, regardless of the scenario complexity.
