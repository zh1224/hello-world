- **Abstrat**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/zongzhao23/STAR-R1.





## Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization: Bridging External Guidance and Internal Capabilities
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15692v2
- **Authors**: ['Jinyang Wu', 'Chonghua Liao', 'Mingkuan Feng', 'Shuai Zhang', 'Zhengqi Wen', 'Pengpeng Shao', 'Huazhe Xu', 'Jianhua Tao']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective method for training reasoning models. However, existing RL approaches typically bias the model's output distribution toward reward-maximizing paths without introducing external knowledge. This limits their exploration capacity and results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. To address this limitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel framework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance ("thought patterns"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during training, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external guidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva Math. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500 prior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models. This highlights TAPO's potential for broader applications across multiple tasks and domains. Our further analysis reveals that introducing external guidance produces powerful reasoning models with superior explainability of inference behavior and enhanced output readability.





## FUDOKI: Discrete Flow-based Unified Understanding and Generation via Kinetic-Optimal Velocities
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20147v1
- **Authors**: ['Jin Wang', 'Yao Lai', 'Aoxue Li', 'Shifeng Zhang', 'Jiacheng Sun', 'Ning Kang', 'Chengyue Wu', 'Zhenguo Li', 'Ping Luo']
- **Abstrat**: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.





## Outcome-based Reinforcement Learning to Predict the Future
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17989v2
- **Authors**: ['Benjamin Turtel', 'Danny Franklin', 'Kris Skotheim', 'Luke Hewitt', 'Philipp Schoenegger']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has boosted math and coding in large language models, yet there has been little effort to extend RLVR into messier, real-world domains like forecasting. One sticking point is that outcome-based reinforcement learning for forecasting must learn from binary, delayed, and noisy rewards, a regime where standard fine-tuning is brittle. We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match frontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical prediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our adaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply baseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally consistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that penalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a single stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and ensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline o1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in calibration (ECE = 0.042, p < 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this calibration edge into \$127 of hypothetical profit versus \$92 for o1 (p = 0.037). This demonstrates that refined RLVR methods can convert small-scale LLMs into potentially economically valuable forecasting tools, with implications for scaling this to larger models.





## MolEditRL: Structure-Preserving Molecular Editing via Discrete Diffusion and Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20131v1
- **Authors**: ['Yuanxin Zhuang', 'Dazhong Shen', 'Ying Sun']
- **Abstrat**: Molecular editing aims to modify a given molecule to optimize desired chemical properties while preserving structural similarity. However, current approaches typically rely on string-based or continuous representations, which fail to adequately capture the discrete, graph-structured nature of molecules, resulting in limited structural fidelity and poor controllability. In this paper, we propose MolEditRL, a molecular editing framework that explicitly integrates structural constraints with precise property optimization. Specifically, MolEditRL consists of two stages: (1) a discrete graph diffusion model pretrained to reconstruct target molecules conditioned on source structures and natural language instructions; (2) an editing-aware reinforcement learning fine-tuning stage that further enhances property alignment and structural preservation by explicitly optimizing editing decisions under graph constraints. For comprehensive evaluation, we construct MolEdit-Instruct, the largest and most property-rich molecular editing dataset, comprising 3 million diverse examples spanning single- and multi-property tasks across 10 chemical attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that MolEditRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both property optimization accuracy and structural fidelity, achieving a 74\% improvement in editing success rate while using 98\% fewer parameters.





## Proxy-Free GFlowNet
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20110v1
- **Authors**: ['Ruishuo Chen', 'Xun Wang', 'Rui Hu', 'Zhuoran Li', 'Longbo Huang']
- **Abstrat**: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a promising class of generative models designed to sample diverse, high-reward structures by modeling distributions over compositional objects. In many real-world applications, obtaining the reward function for such objects is expensive, time-consuming, or requires human input, making it necessary to train GFlowNets from historical datasets. Most existing methods adopt a model-based approach, learning a proxy model from the dataset to approximate the reward function. However, this strategy inherently ties the quality of the learned policy to the accuracy of the proxy, introducing additional complexity and uncertainty into the training process. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN)}, a \emph{proxy-free} training framework that eliminates the need for out-of-dataset reward queries. Our method is motivated by the key observation that different edges in the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG) contribute unequally to effective policy learning. TD-GFN leverages inverse reinforcement learning to estimate edge-level rewards from the offline dataset, which are then used to ingeniously prune the DAG and guide backward trajectory sampling during training. This approach directs the policy toward high-reward regions while reducing the complexity of model fitting. Empirical results across multiple tasks show that TD-GFN trains both efficiently and reliably, significantly outperforming existing baselines in convergence speed and sample quality.





## Refining Few-Step Text-to-Multiview Diffusion via Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20107v1
- **Authors**: ['Ziyi Zhang', 'Li Shen', 'Deheng Ye', 'Yong Luo', 'Huangxuan Zhao', 'Lefei Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: Text-to-multiview (T2MV) generation, which produces coherent multiview images from a single text prompt, remains computationally intensive, while accelerated T2MV methods using few-step diffusion models often sacrifice image fidelity and view consistency. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its few-step efficiency.





## Adaptive Deep Reasoning: Triggering Deep Thinking When Needed
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20101v1
- **Authors**: ['Yunhao Wang', 'Yuhao Zhang', 'Tinghao Yu', 'Can Xu', 'Feng Zhang', 'Fengzong Lian']
- **Abstrat**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in handling complex tasks through long-chain reasoning. However, the extensive reasoning steps involved can significantly increase computational costs, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing reasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning processes through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement learning with length penalties. Although these methods effectively reduce reasoning length, they still necessitate an initial reasoning phase. More recent approaches have attempted to integrate long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities into a single model, yet they still rely on manual control to toggle between short and long CoT.In this work, we propose a novel approach that autonomously switches between short and long reasoning chains based on problem complexity. Our method begins with supervised fine-tuning of the base model to equip both long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities. We then employ reinforcement learning to further balance short and long CoT generation while maintaining accuracy through two key strategies: first, integrating reinforcement learning with a long-short adaptive group-wise reward strategy to assess prompt complexity and provide corresponding rewards; second, implementing a logit-based reasoning mode switching loss to optimize the model's initial token choice, thereby guiding the selection of the reasoning type.Evaluations on mathematical datasets demonstrate that our model can dynamically switch between long-chain and short-chain reasoning modes without substantially sacrificing performance. This advancement enhances the practicality of reasoning in large language models for real-world applications.





## SwarmThinkers: Learning Physically Consistent Atomic KMC Transitions at Scale
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20094v1
- **Authors**: ['Qi Li', 'Kun Li', 'Haozhi Han', 'Honghui Shang', 'Xinfu He', 'Yunquan Zhang', 'Hong An', 'Ting Cao', 'Mao Yang']
- **Abstrat**: Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress, this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system. Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise decision making. Training follows a centralized-training, decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer. It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers, SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven intelligence.





## Curriculum-RLAIF: Curriculum Alignment with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20075v1
- **Authors**: ['Mengdi Li', 'Jiaye Lin', 'Xufeng Zhao', 'Wenhao Lu', 'Peilin Zhao', 'Stefan Wermter', 'Di Wang']
- **Abstrat**: Reward models trained with conventional Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) methods suffer from limited generalizability, which hinders the alignment performance of the policy model during reinforcement learning (RL). This challenge stems from various issues, including distribution shift, preference label noise, and mismatches between overly challenging samples and model capacity. In this paper, we attempt to enhance the generalizability of reward models through a data-centric approach, driven by the insight that these issues are inherently intertwined from the perspective of data difficulty. To address this, we propose a novel framework, $\textit{Curriculum-RLAIF}$, which constructs preference pairs with varying difficulty levels and produces a curriculum that progressively incorporates preference pairs of increasing difficulty for reward model training. Our experimental results suggest that reward models trained with Curriculum-RLAIF achieve improved generalizability, significantly increasing the alignment performance of the policy model by a large margin without incurring additional inference costs compared to various non-curriculum baselines. Detailed analysis and comparisons with alternative approaches, including data selection via external pretrained reward models or internal self-selection mechanisms, as well as other curriculum strategies, further demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness.





## Incentivizing Reasoning from Weak Supervision
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20072v1
- **Authors**: ['Yige Yuan', 'Teng Xiao', 'Shuchang Tao', 'Xue Wang', 'Jinyang Gao', 'Bolin Ding', 'Bingbing Xu']
- **Abstrat**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning-intensive tasks, but enhancing their reasoning abilities typically relies on either reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable signals or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) demonstrations, both of which are expensive. In this paper, we study a novel problem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive high-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively incentivized via supervision from significantly weaker models. We further analyze when and why such weak supervision succeeds in eliciting reasoning abilities in stronger models. Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners can substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to 94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can effectively incentivize reasoning in stronger student models, consistently improving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Our results suggest that this simple weak-to-strong paradigm is a promising and generalizable alternative to costly methods for incentivizing strong reasoning capabilities at inference-time in LLMs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyige/W2SR.





## NoisyRollout: Reinforcing Visual Reasoning with Data Augmentation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13055v2
- **Authors**: ['Xiangyan Liu', 'Jinjie Ni', 'Zijian Wu', 'Chao Du', 'Longxu Dou', 'Haonan Wang', 'Tianyu Pang', 'Michael Qizhe Shieh']
- **Abstrat**: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have strengthened the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, enhancing policy exploration to better scale test-time compute remains largely underexplored. In addition, VLMs continue to struggle with imperfect visual perception, which in turn affects the subsequent reasoning process. To this end, we propose NoisyRollout, a simple yet effective data augmentation method that mixes trajectories from both clean and moderately distorted images during RL training. By injecting targeted diversity in visual perception and the resulting reasoning patterns, NoisyRollout promotes better policy exploration through vision-oriented inductive biases, ultimately leading to more robust reasoning behaviors. We further adopt a noise annealing schedule that gradually reduces distortion strength over training, leveraging noisy signals early on while ensuring training stability in later stages. Crucially, our method is easy-to-adopt--requiring no additional training cost and no modifications to the RL objective. Extensive experiments on $2$ distinct training datasets demonstrate that NoisyRollout achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source RL-tuned models across $5$ out-of-domain reasoning and perception benchmarks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of NoisyRollout across model sizes ($7$B and $32$B) and data scales (from $1$K to $6$K), highlighting its generalizability and scalability.





## VR-Robo: A Real-to-Sim-to-Real Framework for Visual Robot Navigation and Locomotion
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01536v2
- **Authors**: ['Shaoting Zhu', 'Linzhan Mou', 'Derun Li', 'Baijun Ye', 'Runhan Huang', 'Hang Zhao']
- **Abstrat**: Recent success in legged robot locomotion is attributed to the integration of reinforcement learning and physical simulators. However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.





## SafeDPO: A Simple Approach to Direct Preference Optimization with Enhanced Safety
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20065v1
- **Authors**: ['Geon-Hyeong Kim', 'Youngsoo Jang', 'Yu Jin Kim', 'Byoungjip Kim', 'Honglak Lee', 'Kyunghoon Bae', 'Moontae Lee']
- **Abstrat**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance and find applications across a growing number of fields, ensuring the safety of LLMs has become increasingly critical. To address safety concerns, recent studies have proposed integrating safety constraints into Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, these approaches tend to be complex, as they encompass complicated procedures in RLHF along with additional steps required by the safety constraints. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we introduce a new algorithm called SafeDPO, which is designed to directly optimize the safety alignment objective in a single stage of policy learning, without requiring relaxation. SafeDPO introduces only one additional hyperparameter to further enhance safety and requires only minor modifications to standard DPO. As a result, it eliminates the need to fit separate reward and cost models or to sample from the language model during fine-tuning, while still enhancing the safety of LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that SafeDPO achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art safety alignment algorithms, both in terms of aligning with human preferences and improving safety.





## REARANK: Reasoning Re-ranking Agent via Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20046v1
- **Authors**: ['Le Zhang', 'Bo Wang', 'Xipeng Qiu', 'Siva Reddy', 'Aishwarya Agrawal']
- **Abstrat**: We present REARANK, a large language model (LLM)-based listwise reasoning reranking agent. REARANK explicitly reasons before reranking, significantly improving both performance and interpretability. Leveraging reinforcement learning and data augmentation, REARANK achieves substantial improvements over baseline models across popular information retrieval benchmarks, notably requiring only 179 annotated samples. Built on top of Qwen2.5-7B, our REARANK-7B demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4 on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks and even surpasses GPT-4 on reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmarks. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach and highlight how reinforcement learning can enhance LLM reasoning capabilities in reranking.





## The Limits of Preference Data for Post-Training
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19964v1
- **Authors**: ['Eric Zhao', 'Jessica Dai', 'Pranjal Awasthi']
- **Abstrat**: Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models has stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically verifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to optimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires human feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning, outcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of success. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is preference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$ given outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical roadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based optimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and online), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately optimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing an analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose a candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and algorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL post-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these limitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting reasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been historically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding that the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to elicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.





## RAP: Runtime-Adaptive Pruning for LLM Inference
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17138v2
- **Authors**: ['Huanrong Liu', 'Chunlin Tian', 'Xuyang Wei', 'Jiaheng Dai', 'Qin Liu', 'Tianqi Wei', 'Qingbiao Li', 'Li Li']
- **Abstrat**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.





## DeepEyes: Incentivizing "Thinking with Images" via Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14362v2
- **Authors**: ['Ziwei Zheng', 'Michael Yang', 'Jack Hong', 'Chenxiao Zhao', 'Guohai Xu', 'Le Yang', 'Chao Shen', 'Xing Yu']
- **Abstrat**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet they are primarily constrained by text-based reasoning processes. However, achieving seamless integration of visual and textual reasoning which mirrors human cognitive processes remains a significant challenge. In particular, effectively incorporating advanced visual input processing into reasoning mechanisms is still an open question. Thus, in this paper, we explore the interleaved multimodal reasoning paradigm and introduce DeepEyes, a model with "thinking with images" capabilities incentivized through end-to-end reinforcement learning without the need for cold-start SFT. Notably, this ability emerges natively within the model itself, leveraging its inherent grounding ability as a tool instead of depending on separate specialized models. Specifically, we propose a tool-use-oriented data selection mechanism and a reward strategy to encourage successful tool-assisted reasoning trajectories. DeepEyes achieves significant performance gains on fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks and also demonstrates improvement in grounding, hallucination, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Interestingly, we observe the distinct evolution of tool-calling behavior from initial exploration to efficient and accurate exploitation, and diverse thinking patterns that closely mirror human visual reasoning processes. Code is available at https://github.com/Visual-Agent/DeepEyes.





## An Explainable Diagnostic Framework for Neurodegenerative Dementias via Reinforcement-Optimized LLM Reasoning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19954v1
- **Authors**: ['Andrew Zamai', 'Nathanael Fijalkow', 'Boris Mansencal', 'Laurent Simon', 'Eloi Navet', 'Pierrick Coupe']
- **Abstrat**: The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias is a challenging clinical task, mainly because of the overlap in symptom presentation and the similarity of patterns observed in structural neuroimaging. To improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, deep learning-based methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers have been proposed for the automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong predictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their opaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates two core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a modular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual radiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between Frontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based on the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and explainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic reasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or distillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of structured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike post-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions, our framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference process-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the model's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering rationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.

## Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v1
- **Authors**: ['Xinhang Liu', 'Yu-Wing Tai', 'Chi-Keung Tang']
- **Abstrat**: Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.





## GeoPF: Infusing Geometry into Potential Fields for Reactive Planning in Non-trivial Environments
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19688v1
- **Authors**: ['Yuhe Gong', 'Riddhiman Laha', 'Luis Figueredo']
- **Abstrat**: Reactive intelligence remains one of the cornerstones of versatile robotics operating in cluttered, dynamic, and human-centred environments. Among reactive approaches, potential fields (PF) continue to be widely adopted due to their simplicity and real-time applicability. However, existing PF methods typically oversimplify environmental representations by relying on isotropic, point- or sphere-based obstacle approximations. In human-centred settings, this simplification results in overly conservative paths, cumbersome tuning, and computational overhead -- even breaking real-time requirements. In response, we propose the Geometric Potential Field (GeoPF), a reactive motion-planning framework that explicitly infuses geometric primitives - points, lines, planes, cubes, and cylinders - into real-time planning. By leveraging precise closed-form distance functions, GeoPF significantly reduces computational complexity and parameter tuning effort. Extensive quantitative analyses consistently show GeoPF's higher success rates, reduced tuning complexity (a single parameter set across experiments), and substantially lower computational costs (up to 2 orders of magnitude) compared to traditional PF methods. Real-world experiments further validate GeoPF's robustness and practical ease of deployment. GeoPF provides a fresh perspective on reactive planning problems driving geometric-aware temporal motion generation, enabling flexible and low-latency motion planning suitable for modern robotic applications.
