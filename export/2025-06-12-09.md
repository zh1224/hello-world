- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09965v1

- **Abstrat**: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward, text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.





## VerIF: Verification Engineering for Reinforcement Learning in Instruction Following
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09942v1
- **Authors**: ['Hao Peng', 'Yunjia Qi', 'Xiaozhi Wang', 'Bin Xu', 'Lei Hou', 'Juanzi Li']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset, VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving significant improvements across several representative instruction-following benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.





## The Sample Complexity of Online Strategic Decision Making with Information Asymmetry and Knowledge Transportability
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09940v1
- **Authors**: ['Jiachen Hu', 'Rui Ai', 'Han Zhong', 'Xiaoyu Chen', 'Liwei Wang', 'Zhaoran Wang', 'Zhuoran Yang']
- **Abstrat**: Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems, especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards. These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d. actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.





## "What are my options?": Explaining RL Agents with Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (Extended)
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09901v1
- **Authors**: ['Noel Brindise', 'Vijeth Hebbar', 'Riya Shah', 'Cedric Langbort']
- **Abstrat**: In this work, we provide an extended discussion of a new approach to explainable Reinforcement Learning called Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (DNA), first proposed at L4DC 2025. DNA seeks a set of reasonable "options" for trajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively diverse trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these distinct policies are used to "explain" an agent's options in terms of available trajectory shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular, DNA applies to value function-based policies on Markov decision processes where agents are limited to continuous trajectories. Here, we describe DNA, which uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems to solve for distinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality. We show that it successfully returns qualitatively different policies that constitute meaningfully different "options" in simulation, including a brief comparison to related approaches in the stochastic optimization field of Quality Diversity. Beyond the explanatory motivation, this work opens new possibilities for exploration and adaptive planning in RL.

- **Abstrat**: Recent text-to-image systems face limitations in handling multimodal inputs and complex reasoning tasks. We introduce MindOmni, a unified multimodal large language model that addresses these challenges by incorporating reasoning generation through reinforcement learning. MindOmni leverages a three-phase training strategy: i) design of a unified vision language model with a decoder-only diffusion module, ii) supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction data, and iii) our proposed Reasoning Generation Policy Optimization (RGPO) algorithm, utilizing multimodal feedback to effectively guide policy updates. Experimental results demonstrate that MindOmni outperforms existing models, achieving impressive performance on both understanding and generation benchmarks, meanwhile showcasing advanced fine-grained reasoning generation capabilities, especially with mathematical reasoning instruction.

## Hierarchical Learning-Enhanced MPC for Safe Crowd Navigation with Heterogeneous Constraints
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09859v1
- **Authors**: ['Huajian Liu', 'Yixuan Feng', 'Wei Dong', 'Kunpeng Fan', 'Chao Wang', 'Yongzhuo Gao']
- **Abstrat**: In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for robot navigation in dynamic environments with heterogeneous constraints. Our approach leverages a graph neural network trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently estimate the robot's cost-to-go, formulated as local goal recommendations. A spatio-temporal path-searching module, which accounts for kinematic constraints, is then employed to generate a reference trajectory to facilitate solving the non-convex optimization problem used for explicit constraint enforcement. More importantly, we introduce an incremental action-masking mechanism and a privileged learning strategy, enabling end-to-end training of the proposed planner. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses local planning in complex dynamic environments, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared with existing learning-optimization hybrid methods, our approach eliminates the dependency on high-fidelity simulation environments, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency and training scalability. The code will be released as open-source upon acceptance of the paper.





## Foundation Model-Aided Deep Reinforcement Learning for RIS-Assisted Wireless Communication
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09855v1
- **Authors**: ['Mohammad Ghassemi', 'Sara Farrag Mobarak', 'Han Zhang', 'Ali Afana', 'Akram Bin Sediq', 'Melike Erol-Kantarci']
- **Abstrat**: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communication by dynamically controlling signal propagation in the environment. However, their efficient deployment relies on accurate channel state information (CSI), which leads to high channel estimation overhead due to their passive nature and the large number of reflective elements. In this work, we solve this challenge by proposing a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained open-source foundation model (FM) named large wireless model (LWM) to process wireless channels and generate versatile and contextualized channel embeddings. These embeddings are then used for the joint optimization of the BS beamforming and RIS configurations. To be more specific, for joint optimization, we design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to automatically select the BS beamforming vector and RIS phase-shift matrix, aiming to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE). This work shows that a pre-trained FM for radio signal understanding can be fine-tuned and integrated with DRL for effective decision-making in wireless networks. It highlights the potential of modality-specific FMs in real-world network optimization. According to the simulation results, the proposed method outperforms the DRL-based approach and beam sweeping-based approach, achieving 9.89% and 43.66% higher SE, respectively.





## Benchmarking Population-Based Reinforcement Learning across Robotic Tasks with GPU-Accelerated Simulation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03336v4
- **Authors**: ['Asad Ali Shahid', 'Yashraj Narang', 'Vincenzo Petrone', 'Enrico Ferrentino', 'Ankur Handa', 'Dieter Fox', 'Marco Pavone', 'Loris Roveda']
- **Abstrat**: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown its effectiveness in solving complex continuous control tasks. However, this comes at the cost of an enormous amount of experience required for training, exacerbated by the sensitivity of learning efficiency and the policy performance to hyperparameter selection, which often requires numerous trials of time-consuming experiments. This work leverages a Population-Based Reinforcement Learning (PBRL) approach and a GPU-accelerated physics simulator to enhance the exploration capabilities of RL by concurrently training multiple policies in parallel. The PBRL framework is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art RL algorithms -- PPO, SAC, and DDPG -- dynamically adjusting hyperparameters based on the performance of learning agents. The experiments are performed on four challenging tasks in Isaac Gym -- Anymal Terrain, Shadow Hand, Humanoid, Franka Nut Pick -- by analyzing the effect of population size and mutation mechanisms for hyperparameters. The results show that PBRL agents achieve superior performance, in terms of cumulative reward, compared to non-evolutionary baseline agents. Moreover, the trained agents are finally deployed in the real world for a Franka Nut Pick task. To our knowledge, this is the first sim-to-real attempt for deploying PBRL agents on real hardware. Code and videos of the learned policies are available on our project website (https://sites.google.com/view/pbrl).





## Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12501v2
- **Authors**: ['Nathan Lambert']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an important technical and storytelling tool to deploy the latest machine learning systems. In this book, we hope to give a gentle introduction to the core methods for people with some level of quantitative background. The book starts with the origins of RLHF -- both in recent literature and in a convergence of disparate fields of science in economics, philosophy, and optimal control. We then set the stage with definitions, problem formulation, data collection, and other common math used in the literature. The core of the book details every optimization stage in using RLHF, from starting with instruction tuning to training a reward model and finally all of rejection sampling, reinforcement learning, and direct alignment algorithms. The book concludes with advanced topics -- understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation --and open questions for the field.





## CoRT: Code-integrated Reasoning within Thinking

- **Abstrat**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\% and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about 30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available at https://github.com/ChengpengLi1003/CoRT.





## Writing-Zero: Bridge the Gap Between Non-verifiable Tasks and Verifiable Rewards
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00103v2
- **Authors**: ['Ruipeng Jia', 'Yunyi Yang', 'Yongbo Gai', 'Kai Luo', 'Shihao Huang', 'Jianhe Lin', 'Xiaoxi Jiang', 'Guanjun Jiang']
- **Abstrat**: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation. However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences, which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable, verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based, reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework, thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm applicable across all language tasks.





## Automatic Treatment Planning using Reinforcement Learning for High-dose-rate Prostate Brachytherapy
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09805v1
- **Authors**: ['Tonghe Wang', 'Yining Feng', 'Xiaofeng Yang']
- **Abstrat**: Purpose: In high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy procedures, the pattern of needle placement solely relies on physician experience. We investigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide needle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning stage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan quality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of one selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined reward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent then moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple rounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached. Plan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for testing) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric metrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the clinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical plans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no statistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate V150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans use 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the first study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to autonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans. This RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to conventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles. With minimal data requirements and strong generalizability, this approach has substantial potential to standardize brachytherapy planning, reduce clinical variability, and enhance patient outcomes.





## Reinforced Refinement with Self-Aware Expansion for End-to-End Autonomous Driving
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09800v1
- **Authors**: ['Haochen Liu', 'Tianyu Li', 'Haohan Yang', 'Li Chen', 'Caojun Wang', 'Ke Guo', 'Haochen Tian', 'Hongchen Li', 'Hongyang Li', 'Chen Lv']
- **Abstrat**: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for directly mapping sensor inputs to planning maneuvers using learning-based modular integrations. However, existing imitation learning (IL)-based models suffer from generalization to hard cases, and a lack of corrective feedback loop under post-deployment. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential solution to tackle hard cases with optimality, it is often hindered by overfitting to specific driving cases, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge and sample inefficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose Reinforced Refinement with Self-aware Expansion (R2SE), a novel learning pipeline that constantly refines hard domain while keeping generalizable driving policy for model-agnostic end-to-end driving systems. Through reinforcement fine-tuning and policy expansion that facilitates continuous improvement, R2SE features three key components: 1) Generalist Pretraining with hard-case allocation trains a generalist imitation learning (IL) driving system while dynamically identifying failure-prone cases for targeted refinement; 2) Residual Reinforced Specialist Fine-tuning optimizes residual corrections using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in hard case domain while preserving global driving knowledge; 3) Self-aware Adapter Expansion dynamically integrates specialist policies back into the generalist model, enhancing continuous performance improvement. Experimental results in closed-loop simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate improvements in generalization, safety, and long-horizon policy robustness over state-of-the-art E2E systems, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforce refinement for scalable autonomous driving.





## UAV-Enabled Data Collection for IoT Networks via Rainbow Learning

- **Authors**: ['Yingchao Jiao', 'Xuhui Zhang', 'Wenchao Liu', 'Yinyu Wu', 'Jinke Ren', 'Yanyan Shen', 'Bo Yang', 'Xinping Guan']
- **Abstrat**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enabled Internet of things (IoT) systems have become an important part of future wireless communications. To achieve higher communication rate, the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation is crucial. In this paper, a multi-antenna UAV is dispatched to simultaneously collect data from multiple ground IoT nodes (GNs) within a time interval. To improve the sum data collection (SDC) volume from the GNs, the UAV trajectory, the UAV receive beamforming, the scheduling of the GNs, and the transmit power of the GNs are jointly optimized. Since the problem is non-convex and the variables are highly coupled, it is hard to be solved using traditional methods. To find a near-optimal solution, a double-loop structured optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, called rainbow learning based algorithm (RLA), and a fully DRL-based algorithm are proposed to solve the problem effectively. Specifically, the outer-loop of the RLA utilizes a fusion deep Q-network to optimize the UAV trajectory, GN scheduling, and power allocation, while the inner-loop optimizes receive beamforming by successive convex approximation. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms outperform two benchmarks with significant improvement in SDC volumes, energy efficiency, and fairness.





## ComfyUI-R1: Exploring Reasoning Models for Workflow Generation

- **Abstrat**: AI-generated content has evolved from monolithic models to modular workflows, particularly on platforms like ComfyUI, enabling customization in creative pipelines. However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2) reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate, node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code. Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art creation.

- **Abstrat**: Humor, deeply rooted in societal meanings and cultural details, poses a unique challenge for machines. While advances have been made in natural language processing, real-world humor often thrives in a multi-modal context, encapsulated distinctively by memes. This paper poses a particular emphasis on the impact of multi-images on meme captioning. After that, we introduce the \textsc{XMeCap} framework, a novel approach that adopts supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning based on an innovative reward model, which factors in both global and local similarities between visuals and text. Our results, benchmarked against contemporary models, manifest a marked improvement in caption generation for both single-image and multi-image memes, as well as different meme categories. \textsc{XMeCap} achieves an average evaluation score of 75.85 for single-image memes and 66.32 for multi-image memes, outperforming the best baseline by 6.75\% and 8.56\%, respectively. This research not only establishes a new frontier in meme-related studies but also underscores the potential of machines in understanding and generating humor in a multi-modal setting.

- **Abstrat**: Reasoning language models (RLMs), also known as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Alibaba's QwQ, have redefined AI's problem-solving capabilities by extending LLMs with advanced reasoning mechanisms. Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures - uniquely combining reinforcement learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision schemes (Outcome-Based and Process-Based Supervision), and other related concepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent tools). We also provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM cloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM ecosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between "rich AI" and "poor AI" by lowering barriers to RLM design and experimentation.





## Beyond Bradley-Terry Models: A General Preference Model for Language Model Alignment
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02197v3
- **Authors**: ['Yifan Zhang', 'Ge Zhang', 'Yue Wu', 'Kangping Xu', 'Quanquan Gu']
- **Abstrat**: Modeling human preferences is crucial for aligning foundation models with human values. Traditional reward modeling methods, such as the Bradley-Terry (BT) reward model, fall short in expressiveness, particularly in addressing intransitive preferences. In this paper, we introduce preference embedding, an approach that embeds responses into a latent space to capture intricate preference structures efficiently, achieving linear query complexity. Additionally, we propose preference score-based General Preference Optimization (GPO), which generalizes reward-based reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Experimental results show that our General Preference embedding Model (GPM) consistently outperforms the BT reward model on the RewardBench benchmark and effectively models cyclic preferences where any BT reward model behaves like a random guess. Furthermore, evaluations on downstream tasks such as AlpacaEval2.0, following the language model post-training with GPO and our general preference model, reveal performance improvements over BT models. These findings indicate that our method may enhance the alignment of foundation models with nuanced human values.

## From Theory to Practice: Advancing Multi-Robot Path Planning Algorithms and Applications
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09914v1
- **Authors**: ['Teng Guo']
- **Abstrat**: The labeled MRPP (Multi-Robot Path Planning) problem involves routing robots from start to goal configurations efficiently while avoiding collisions. Despite progress in solution quality and runtime, its complexity and industrial relevance continue to drive research.   This dissertation introduces scalable MRPP methods with provable guarantees and practical heuristics. First, we study dense MRPP on 2D grids, relevant to warehouse and parcel systems. We propose the Rubik Table method, achieving $(1 + \delta)$-optimal makespan (with $\delta \in (0, 0.5]$) for up to $\frac{m_1 m_2}{2}$ robots, solving large instances efficiently and setting a new theoretical benchmark.   Next, we address real-world MRPP. We design optimal layouts for structured environments (e.g., warehouses, parking systems) and propose a puzzle-based system for dense, deadlock-free autonomous vehicle parking. We also extend MRPP to Reeds-Shepp robots, introducing motion primitives and smoothing techniques to ensure feasible, efficient paths under nonholonomic constraints. Simulations and real-world tests validate the approach in urban driving and robotic transport scenarios.

## HiBerNAC: Hierarchical Brain-emulated Robotic Neural Agent Collective for Disentangling Complex Manipulation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08296v2
- **Authors**: ['Hongjun Wu', 'Heng Zhang', 'Pengsong Zhang', 'Jin Wang', 'Cong Wang']
- **Abstrat**: Recent advances in multimodal vision-language-action (VLA) models have revolutionized traditional robot learning, enabling systems to interpret vision, language, and action in unified frameworks for complex task planning. However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.





## The Path is the Goal: a Study on the Nature and Effects of Shortest-Path Stability Under Perturbation of Destination

- **Abstrat**: This work examines the phenomenon of path variability in urban navigation, where small changes in destination might lead to significantly different suggested routes. Starting from an observation of this variability over the city of Barcelona, we explore whether this is a localized or widespread occurrence and identify factors influencing path variability. We introduce the concept of "path stability", a measure of how robust a suggested route is to minor destination adjustments, define a detailed experimentation process and apply it across multiple cities worldwide. Our analysis shows that path stability is shaped by city-specific factors and trip characteristics, also identifying some common patterns. Results reveal significant heterogeneity in path stability across cities, allowing for categorization into "stable" and "unstable" cities. These findings offer new insights for urban planning and traffic management, highlighting opportunities for optimizing navigation systems to enhance route consistency and urban mobility.

- **Abstrat**: The logic-constrained shortest path problem (LCSPP) combines a one-to-one shortest path problem with satisfiability constraints imposed on the routing graph. This setting arises in flight planning, where air traffic control (ATC) authorities are enforcing a set of traffic flow restrictions (TFRs) on aircraft routes in order to increase safety and throughput. We propose a new branch and bound-based algorithm for the LCSPP. The resulting algorithm has three main degrees of freedom: the node selection rule, the branching rule and the conflict. While node selection and branching rules have been long studied in the MIP and SAT communities, most of them cannot be applied out of the box for the LCSPP. We review the existing literature and develop tailored variants of the most prominent rules. The conflict, the set of variables to which the branching rule is applied, is unique to the LCSPP. We analyze its theoretical impact on the B&B algorithm. In the second part of the paper, we show how to model the flight planning problem with TFRs as an LCSPP and solve it using the branch and bound algorithm. We demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency on a dataset consisting of a global flight graph and a set of around 20000 real TFRs obtained from our industry partner Lufthansa Systems GmbH. We make this dataset publicly available. Finally, we conduct an empirical in-depth analysis of dynamic shortest path algorithms, node selection rules, branching rules and conflicts. Carefully choosing an appropriate combination yields an improvement of an order of magnitude compared to an uninformed choice.





## Optimizing Cooperative Multi-Object Tracking using Graph Signal Processing

- **Abstrat**: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving systems, as it lays the foundations for advanced perception and precise path planning modules. Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles. By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset, where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks, including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various testing sequences.
