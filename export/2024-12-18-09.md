- **Abstrat**: This paper enables real-world humanoid robots to maintain stability while performing expressive motions like humans do. We propose ExBody2, a generalized whole-body tracking framework that can take any reference motion inputs and control the humanoid to mimic the motion. The model is trained in simulation with Reinforcement Learning and then transferred to the real world. It decouples keypoint tracking with velocity control, and effectively leverages a privileged teacher policy to distill precise mimic skills into the target student policy, which enables high-fidelity replication of dynamic movements such as running, crouching, dancing, and other challenging motions. We present a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of crucial design factors in the paper. We conduct our experiments on two humanoid platforms and demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-arts, providing practical guidelines to pursue the extreme of whole-body control for humanoid robots.





## Tilted Quantile Gradient Updates for Quantile-Constrained Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13184v1
- **Authors**: ['Chenglin Li', 'Guangchun Ruan', 'Hua Geng']
- **Abstrat**: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular and versatile paradigm to learn reward-maximizing policies with safety guarantees. Previous works tend to express the safety constraints in an expectation form due to the ease of implementation, but this turns out to be ineffective in maintaining safety constraints with high probability. To this end, we move to the quantile-constrained RL that enables a higher level of safety without any expectation-form approximations. We directly estimate the quantile gradients through sampling and provide the theoretical proofs of convergence. Then a tilted update strategy for quantile gradients is implemented to compensate the asymmetric distributional density, with a direct benefit of return performance. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model fully meets safety requirements (quantile constraints) while outperforming the state-of-the-art benchmarks with higher return.





## Learning Visuotactile Estimation and Control for Non-prehensile Manipulation under Occlusions
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13157v1
- **Authors**: ['Juan Del Aguila Ferrandis', 'Jo√£o Moura', 'Sethu Vijayakumar']
- **Abstrat**: Manipulation without grasping, known as non-prehensile manipulation, is essential for dexterous robots in contact-rich environments, but presents many challenges relating with underactuation, hybrid-dynamics, and frictional uncertainty. Additionally, object occlusions in a scenario of contact uncertainty and where the motion of the object evolves independently from the robot becomes a critical problem, which previous literature fails to address. We present a method for learning visuotactile state estimators and uncertainty-aware control policies for non-prehensile manipulation under occlusions, by leveraging diverse interaction data from privileged policies trained in simulation. We formulate the estimator within a Bayesian deep learning framework, to model its uncertainty, and then train uncertainty-aware control policies by incorporating the pre-learned estimator into the reinforcement learning (RL) loop, both of which lead to significantly improved estimator and policy performance. Therefore, unlike prior non-prehensile research that relies on complex external perception set-ups, our method successfully handles occlusions after sim-to-real transfer to robotic hardware with a simple onboard camera.

- **Abstrat**: This paper surveys research in the rapidly growing field of enhancing large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL), a technique that enables LLMs to improve their performance by receiving feedback in the form of rewards based on the quality of their outputs, allowing them to generate more accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate responses. In this work, we make a systematic review of the most up-to-date state of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze the rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the current challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of RL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two widely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4) explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the reward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs with human expectations. We will also point out current challenges and deficiencies of existing methods and suggest some avenues for further improvements.

## Practicable Black-box Evasion Attacks on Link Prediction in Dynamic Graphs -- A Graph Sequential Embedding Method
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13134v1
- **Authors**: ['Jiate Li', 'Meng Pang', 'Binghui Wang']
- **Abstrat**: Link prediction in dynamic graphs (LPDG) has been widely applied to real-world applications such as website recommendation, traffic flow prediction, organizational studies, etc. These models are usually kept local and secure, with only the interactive interface restrictively available to the public. Thus, the problem of the black-box evasion attack on the LPDG model, where model interactions and data perturbations are restricted, seems to be essential and meaningful in practice. In this paper, we propose the first practicable black-box evasion attack method that achieves effective attacks against the target LPDG model, within a limited amount of interactions and perturbations. To perform effective attacks under limited perturbations, we develop a graph sequential embedding model to find the desired state embedding of the dynamic graph sequences, under a deep reinforcement learning framework. To overcome the scarcity of interactions, we design a multi-environment training pipeline and train our agent for multiple instances, by sharing an aggregate interaction buffer. Finally, we evaluate our attack against three advanced LPDG models on three real-world graph datasets of different scales and compare its performance with related methods under the interaction and perturbation constraints. Experimental results show that our attack is both effective and practicable.





## Active Reinforcement Learning Strategies for Offline Policy Improvement
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13106v1
- **Authors**: ['Ambedkar Dukkipati', 'Ranga Shaarad Ayyagari', 'Bodhisattwa Dasgupta', 'Parag Dutta', 'Prabhas Reddy Onteru']
- **Abstrat**: Learning agents that excel at sequential decision-making tasks must continuously resolve the problem of exploration and exploitation for optimal learning. However, such interactions with the environment online might be prohibitively expensive and may involve some constraints, such as a limited budget for agent-environment interactions and restricted exploration in certain regions of the state space. Examples include selecting candidates for medical trials and training agents in complex navigation environments. This problem necessitates the study of active reinforcement learning strategies that collect minimal additional experience trajectories by reusing existing offline data previously collected by some unknown behavior policy. In this work, we propose a representation-aware uncertainty-based active trajectory collection method that intelligently decides interaction strategies that consider the distribution of the existing offline data. With extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our proposed method reduces additional online interaction with the environment by up to 75% over competitive baselines across various continuous control environments.





## Agentic AI-Driven Technical Troubleshooting for Enterprise Systems: A Novel Weighted Retrieval-Augmented Generation Paradigm
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12006v2
- **Authors**: ['Rajat Khanda']
- **Abstrat**: Technical troubleshooting in enterprise environments often involves navigating diverse, heterogeneous data sources to resolve complex issues effectively. This paper presents a novel agentic AI solution built on a Weighted Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework tailored for enterprise technical troubleshooting. By dynamically weighting retrieval sources such as product manuals, internal knowledge bases, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides based on query context, the framework prioritizes the most relevant data. For instance, it gives precedence to product manuals for SKU-specific queries while incorporating general FAQs for broader issues. The system employs FAISS for efficient dense vector search, coupled with a dynamic aggregation mechanism to seamlessly integrate results from multiple sources. A Llama-based self-evaluator ensures the contextual accuracy and confidence of the generated responses before delivering them. This iterative cycle of retrieval and validation enhances precision, diversity, and reliability in response generation. Preliminary evaluations on large enterprise datasets demonstrate the framework's efficacy in improving troubleshooting accuracy, reducing resolution times, and adapting to varied technical challenges. Future research aims to enhance the framework by integrating advanced conversational AI capabilities, enabling more interactive and intuitive troubleshooting experiences. Efforts will also focus on refining the dynamic weighting mechanism through reinforcement learning to further optimize the relevance and precision of retrieved information. By incorporating these advancements, the proposed framework is poised to evolve into a comprehensive, autonomous AI solution, redefining technical service workflows across enterprise settings.





## Reservoir Computing for Fast, Simplified Reinforcement Learning on Memory Tasks
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13093v1
- **Authors**: ['Kevin McKee']
- **Abstrat**: Tasks in which rewards depend upon past information not available in the current observation set can only be solved by agents that are equipped with short-term memory. Usual choices for memory modules include trainable recurrent hidden layers, often with gated memory. Reservoir computing presents an alternative, in which a recurrent layer is not trained, but rather has a set of fixed, sparse recurrent weights. The weights are scaled to produce stable dynamical behavior such that the reservoir state contains a high-dimensional, nonlinear impulse response function of the inputs. An output decoder network can then be used to map the compressive history represented by the reservoir's state to any outputs, including agent actions or predictions. In this study, we find that reservoir computing greatly simplifies and speeds up reinforcement learning on memory tasks by (1) eliminating the need for backpropagation of gradients through time, (2) presenting all recent history simultaneously to the downstream network, and (3) performing many useful and generic nonlinear computations upstream from the trained modules. In particular, these findings offer significant benefit to meta-learning that depends primarily on efficient and highly general memory systems.





## Walk Wisely on Graph: Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Dual Agents via Efficient Guidance-Exploration
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01880v3
- **Authors**: ['Zijian Wang', 'Bin Wang', 'Haifeng Jing', 'Huayu Li', 'Hongbo Dou']
- **Abstrat**: Recent years, multi-hop reasoning has been widely studied for knowledge graph (KG) reasoning due to its efficacy and interpretability. However, previous multi-hop reasoning approaches are subject to two primary shortcomings. First, agents struggle to learn effective and robust policies at the early phase due to sparse rewards. Second, these approaches often falter on specific datasets like sparse knowledge graphs, where agents are required to traverse lengthy reasoning paths. To address these problems, we propose a multi-hop reasoning model with dual agents based on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which is named FULORA. FULORA tackles the above reasoning challenges by eFficient GUidance-ExpLORAtion between dual agents. The high-level agent walks on the simplified knowledge graph to provide stage-wise hints for the low-level agent walking on the original knowledge graph. In this framework, the low-level agent optimizes a value function that balances two objectives: (1) maximizing return, and (2) integrating efficient guidance from the high-level agent. Experiments conducted on three real-word knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that FULORA outperforms RL-based baselines, especially in the case of long-distance reasoning.





## SMOSE: Sparse Mixture of Shallow Experts for Interpretable Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control Tasks
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13053v1
- **Authors**: ['M√°ty√°s Vincze', 'Laura Ferrarotti', 'Leonardo Lucio Custode', 'Bruno Lepri', 'Giovanni Iacca']
- **Abstrat**: Continuous control tasks often involve high-dimensional, dynamic, and non-linear environments. State-of-the-art performance in these tasks is achieved through complex closed-box policies that are effective, but suffer from an inherent opacity. Interpretable policies, while generally underperforming compared to their closed-box counterparts, advantageously facilitate transparent decision-making within automated systems. Hence, their usage is often essential for diagnosing and mitigating errors, supporting ethical and legal accountability, and fostering trust among stakeholders. In this paper, we propose SMOSE, a novel method to train sparsely activated interpretable controllers, based on a top-1 Mixture-of-Experts architecture. SMOSE combines a set of interpretable decisionmakers, trained to be experts in different basic skills, and an interpretable router that assigns tasks among the experts. The training is carried out via state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning algorithms, exploiting load-balancing techniques to ensure fair expert usage. We then distill decision trees from the weights of the router, significantly improving the ease of interpretation. We evaluate SMOSE on six benchmark environments from MuJoCo: our method outperforms recent interpretable baselines and narrows the gap with noninterpretable state-of-the-art algorithms





## Unleashing the Power of Pre-trained Language Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20587v5
- **Authors**: ['Ruizhe Shi', 'Yuyao Liu', 'Yanjie Ze', 'Simon S. Du', 'Huazhe Xu']
- **Abstrat**: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find a near-optimal policy using pre-collected datasets. In real-world scenarios, data collection could be costly and risky; therefore, offline RL becomes particularly challenging when the in-domain data is limited. Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their few-shot learning prowess, this paper introduces $\textbf{La}$nguage Models for $\textbf{Mo}$tion Control ($\textbf{LaMo}$), a general framework based on Decision Transformers to effectively use pre-trained Language Models (LMs) for offline RL. Our framework highlights four crucial components: (1) Initializing Decision Transformers with sequentially pre-trained LMs, (2) employing the LoRA fine-tuning method, in contrast to full-weight fine-tuning, to combine the pre-trained knowledge from LMs and in-domain knowledge effectively, (3) using the non-linear MLP transformation instead of linear projections, to generate embeddings, and (4) integrating an auxiliary language prediction loss during fine-tuning to stabilize the LMs and retain their original abilities on languages. Empirical results indicate $\textbf{LaMo}$ achieves excellent performance in sparse-reward tasks and closes the gap between value-based offline RL methods and decision transformers in dense-reward tasks. In particular, our method demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with limited data samples.





## Relational Neurosymbolic Markov Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13023v1
- **Authors**: ['Lennert De Smet', 'Gabriele Venturato', 'Luc De Raedt', 'Giuseppe Marra']
- **Abstrat**: Sequential problems are ubiquitous in AI, such as in reinforcement learning or natural language processing. State-of-the-art deep sequential models, like transformers, excel in these settings but fail to guarantee the satisfaction of constraints necessary for trustworthy deployment. In contrast, neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) provides a sound formalism to enforce constraints in deep probabilistic models but scales exponentially on sequential problems. To overcome these limitations, we introduce relational neurosymbolic Markov models (NeSy-MMs), a new class of end-to-end differentiable sequential models that integrate and provably satisfy relational logical constraints. We propose a strategy for inference and learning that scales on sequential settings, and that combines approximate Bayesian inference, automated reasoning, and gradient estimation. Our experiments show that NeSy-MMs can solve problems beyond the current state-of-the-art in neurosymbolic AI and still provide strong guarantees with respect to desired properties. Moreover, we show that our models are more interpretable and that constraints can be adapted at test time to out-of-distribution scenarios.





## FootstepNet: an Efficient Actor-Critic Method for Fast On-line Bipedal Footstep Planning and Forecasting
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12589v2
- **Authors**: ['Cl√©ment Gaspard', 'Gr√©goire Passault', 'M√©lodie Daniel', 'Olivier Ly']
- **Abstrat**: Designing a humanoid locomotion controller is challenging and classically split up in sub-problems. Footstep planning is one of those, where the sequence of footsteps is defined. Even in simpler environments, finding a minimal sequence, or even a feasible sequence, yields a complex optimization problem. In the literature, this problem is usually addressed by search-based algorithms (e.g. variants of A*). However, such approaches are either computationally expensive or rely on hand-crafted tuning of several parameters. In this work, at first, we propose an efficient footstep planning method to navigate in local environments with obstacles, based on state-of-the art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques, with very low computational requirements for on-line inference. Our approach is heuristic-free and relies on a continuous set of actions to generate feasible footsteps. In contrast, other methods necessitate the selection of a relevant discrete set of actions. Second, we propose a forecasting method, allowing to quickly estimate the number of footsteps required to reach different candidates of local targets. This approach relies on inherent computations made by the actor-critic DRL architecture. We demonstrate the validity of our approach with simulation results, and by a deployment on a kid-size humanoid robot during the RoboCup 2023 competition.





## Future Aspects in Human Action Recognition: Exploring Emerging Techniques and Ethical Influences

- **Abstrat**: Visual-based human action recognition can be found in various application fields, e.g., surveillance systems, sports analytics, medical assistive technologies, or human-robot interaction frameworks, and it concerns the identification and classification of individuals' activities within a video. Since actions typically occur over a sequence of consecutive images, it is particularly challenging due to the inclusion of temporal analysis, which introduces an extra layer of complexity. However, although multiple approaches try to handle temporal analysis, there are still difficulties because of their computational cost and lack of adaptability. Therefore, different types of vision data, containing transition information between consecutive images, provided by next-generation hardware sensors will guide the robotics community in tackling the problem of human action recognition. On the other hand, while there is a plethora of still-image datasets, that researchers can adopt to train new artificial intelligence models, videos representing human activities are of limited capabilities, e.g., small and unbalanced datasets or selected without control from multiple sources. To this end, generating new and realistic synthetic videos is possible since labeling is performed throughout the data creation process, while reinforcement learning techniques can permit the avoidance of considerable dataset dependence. At the same time, human factors' involvement raises ethical issues for the research community, as doubts and concerns about new technologies already exist.





## Guiding Generative Protein Language Models with Reinforcement Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12979v1
- **Authors**: ['Filippo Stocco', 'Maria Artigues-Lleixa', 'Andrea Hunklinger', 'Talal Widatalla', 'Marc Guell', 'Noelia Ferruz']
- **Abstrat**: Autoregressive protein language models (pLMs) have emerged as powerful tools to efficiently design functional proteins with extraordinary diversity, as evidenced by the successful generation of diverse enzyme families, including lysozymes or carbonic anhydrases. However, a fundamental limitation of pLMs is their propensity to sample from dense regions within the training distribution, which constrains their ability to sample from rare, high-value regions of the sequence space. This limitation becomes particularly critical in applications targeting underrepresented distribution tails, such as engineering for enzymatic activity or binding affinity. To address this challenge, we implement DPO_pLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for protein sequence optimization with pLMs. Drawing inspiration from the success of RL in aligning language models to human preferences, we approach protein optimization as an iterative process that fine-tunes pLM weights to maximize a reward provided by an external oracle. Our strategy demonstrates that RL can efficiently optimize for a variety of custom properties without the need for additional data, achieving significant while preserving sequence diversity. We applied DPO_pLM to the design of EGFR binders, successfully identifying nanomolar binders within hours. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/AI4PDLab/DPO_pLM.





## Coordinating Planning and Tracking in Layered Control Policies via Actor-Critic Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01639v2
- **Authors**: ['Fengjun Yang', 'Nikolai Matni']
- **Abstrat**: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm to jointly train (1) a trajectory planner and (2) a tracking controller in a layered control architecture. Our algorithm arises naturally from a rewrite of the underlying optimal control problem that lends itself to an actor-critic learning approach. By explicitly learning a \textit{dual} network to coordinate the interaction between the planning and tracking layers, we demonstrate the ability to achieve an effective consensus between the two components, leading to an interpretable policy. We theoretically prove that our algorithm converges to the optimal dual network in the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting and empirically validate its applicability to nonlinear systems through simulation experiments on a unicycle model.





## Emma-X: An Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning

- **Abstrat**: Traditional reinforcement learning-based robotic control methods are often task-specific and fail to generalize across diverse environments or unseen objects and instructions. Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and planning capabilities but lack the ability to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, Emma-X. Emma-X leverages our constructed hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, containing 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories auto-annotated with grounded task reasoning and spatial guidance. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy based on gripper states and motion trajectories, which can help mitigate hallucination in grounding subtask reasoning generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Emma-X achieves superior performance over competitive baselines, particularly in real-world robotic tasks requiring spatial reasoning.





## Design of Restricted Normalizing Flow towards Arbitrary Stochastic Policy with Computational Efficiency
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12894v1
- **Authors**: ['Taisuke Kobayashi', 'Takumi Aotani']
- **Abstrat**: This paper proposes a new design method for a stochastic control policy using a normalizing flow (NF). In reinforcement learning (RL), the policy is usually modeled as a distribution model with trainable parameters. When this parameterization has less expressiveness, it would fail to acquiring the optimal policy. A mixture model has capability of a universal approximation, but it with too much redundancy increases the computational cost, which can become a bottleneck when considering the use of real-time robot control. As another approach, NF, which is with additional parameters for invertible transformation from a simple stochastic model as a base, is expected to exert high expressiveness and lower computational cost. However, NF cannot compute its mean analytically due to complexity of the invertible transformation, and it lacks reliability because it retains stochastic behaviors after deployment for robot controller. This paper therefore designs a restricted NF (RNF) that achieves an analytic mean by appropriately restricting the invertible transformation. In addition, the expressiveness impaired by this restriction is regained using bimodal student-t distribution as its base, so-called Bit-RNF. In RL benchmarks, Bit-RNF policy outperformed the previous models. Finally, a real robot experiment demonstrated the applicability of Bit-RNF policy to real world.

## LLMLight: Large Language Models as Traffic Signal Control Agents

- **Authors**: ['Siqi Lai', 'Zhao Xu', 'Weijia Zhang', 'Hao Liu', 'Hui Xiong']
- **Abstrat**: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is a crucial component in urban traffic management, aiming to optimize road network efficiency and reduce congestion. Traditional TSC methods, primarily based on transportation engineering and reinforcement learning (RL), often struggle with generalization abilities across varied traffic scenarios and lack interpretability. This paper presents LLMLight, a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-making agents for TSC. Specifically, the framework begins by instructing the LLM with a knowledgeable prompt detailing real-time traffic conditions. Leveraging the advanced generalization capabilities of LLMs, LLMLight engages a reasoning and decision-making process akin to human intuition for effective traffic control. Moreover, we build LightGPT, a specialized backbone LLM tailored for TSC tasks. By learning nuanced traffic patterns and control strategies, LightGPT enhances the LLMLight framework cost-effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-world and synthetic datasets, along with evaluations by fifteen human experts, demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability of LLMLight with LightGPT, outperforming nine baseline methods and ten advanced LLMs.

## On approximating shortest paths in weighted triangular tessellations
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13912v2
- **Authors**: ['Prosenjit Bose', 'Guillermo Esteban', 'David Orden', 'Rodrigo I. Silveira']
- **Abstrat**: We study the quality of weighted shortest paths when a continuous 2-dimensional space is discretized by a weighted triangular tessellation. In order to evaluate how well the tessellation approximates the 2-dimensional space, we study three types of shortest paths: a weighted shortest path $ \mathit{SP_w}(s,t) $, which is a shortest path from $ s $ to $ t $ in the space; a weighted shortest vertex path $ \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t) $, which is an any-angle shortest path; and a weighted shortest grid path $ \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t) $, which is a shortest path whose edges are edges of the tessellation.   Given any arbitrary weight assignment to the faces of a triangular tessellation, thus extending recent results by Bailey et al. [Path-length analysis for grid-based path planning. Artificial Intelligence, 301:103560, 2021], we prove upper and lower bounds on the ratios $ \frac{\lVert \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\rVert} $, $ \frac{\lVert \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\rVert} $, $ \frac{\lVert \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t)\rVert} $, which provide estimates on the quality of the approximation.   It turns out, surprisingly, that our worst-case bounds are independent of any weight assignment. Our main result is that $ \frac{\lVert \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\rVert} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.15 $ in the worst case, and this is tight. As a corollary, for the weighted any-angle path $ \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t) $ we obtain the approximation result $ \frac{\lVert \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\rVert} \lessapprox 1.15 $.





## Neural-Network-Driven Reward Prediction as a Heuristic: Advancing Q-Learning for Mobile Robot Path Planning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12650v1
- **Authors**: ['Yiming Ji', 'Kaijie Yun', 'Yang Liu', 'Zongwu Xie', 'Hong Liu']
- **Abstrat**: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning technique for solving path planning problems. It primarily involves the interaction between an agent and its environment, enabling the agent to learn an optimal strategy that maximizes cumulative rewards. Although many studies have reported the effectiveness of Q-learning, it still faces slow convergence issues in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose the NDR-QL method, which utilizes neural network outputs as heuristic information to accelerate the convergence process of Q-learning. Specifically, we improved the dual-output neural network model by introducing a start-end channel separation mechanism and enhancing the feature fusion process. After training, the proposed NDR model can output a narrowly focused optimal probability distribution, referred to as the guideline, and a broadly distributed suboptimal distribution, referred to as the region. Subsequently, based on the guideline prediction, we calculate the continuous reward function for the Q-learning method, and based on the region prediction, we initialize the Q-table with a bias. We conducted training, validation, and path planning simulation experiments on public datasets. The results indicate that the NDR model outperforms previous methods by up to 5\% in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed NDR-QL method improves the convergence speed of the baseline Q-learning method by 90\% and also surpasses the previously improved Q-learning methods in path quality metrics.





## Decictor: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving Systems

- **Authors**: ['Mingfei Cheng', 'Yuan Zhou', 'Xiaofei Xie', 'Junjie Wang', 'Guozhu Meng', 'Kairui Yang']
- **Abstrat**: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is crucial in ADS development, with the current primary focus being on safety. However, the evaluation of non-safety-critical performance, particularly the ADS's ability to make optimal decisions and produce optimal paths for autonomous vehicles (AVs), is also vital to ensure the intelligence and reduce risks of AVs. Currently, there is little work dedicated to assessing the robustness of ADSs' path-planning decisions (PPDs), i.e., whether an ADS can maintain the optimal PPD after an insignificant change in the environment. The key challenges include the lack of clear oracles for assessing PPD optimality and the difficulty in searching for scenarios that lead to non-optimal PPDs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on evaluating the robustness of ADSs' PPDs and propose the first method, Decictor, for generating non-optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), where the ADS does not plan optimal paths for AVs. Decictor comprises three main components: Non-invasive Mutation, Consistency Check, and Feedback. To overcome the oracle challenge, Non-invasive Mutation is devised to implement conservative modifications, ensuring the preservation of the original optimal path in the mutated scenarios. Subsequently, the Consistency Check is applied to determine the presence of non-optimal PPDs by comparing the driving paths in the original and mutated scenarios. To deal with the challenge of large environment space, we design Feedback metrics that integrate spatial and temporal dimensions of the AV's movement. These metrics are crucial for effectively steering the generation of NoDSs. We evaluate Decictor on Baidu Apollo, an open-source and production-grade ADS. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of Decictor in detecting non-optimal PPDs of ADSs.





## SEED: Accelerating Reasoning Tree Construction via Scheduled Speculative Decoding
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18200v2
- **Authors**: ['Zhenglin Wang', 'Jialong Wu', 'Yilong Lai', 'Congzhi Zhang', 'Deyu Zhou']
- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities across various tasks, yet fall short of complex reasoning and planning tasks. The tree-search-based reasoning methods address this by surpassing the capabilities of chain-of-thought prompting, encouraging exploration of intermediate steps. However, such methods introduce significant inference latency due to the systematic exploration and evaluation of multiple thought paths. This paper introduces SeeD, a novel and efficient inference framework to optimize runtime speed and GPU memory management concurrently. By employing a scheduled speculative execution, SeeD efficiently handles multiple iterations for the thought generation and the state evaluation, leveraging a rounds-scheduled strategy to manage draft model dispatching. Extensive experimental evaluations on three reasoning datasets demonstrate superior speedup performance of SeeD, providing a viable path for batched inference in training-free speculative decoding.
